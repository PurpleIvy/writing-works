### Stuff I did

- Sorted out my Uni email account
- Sorted out the majority of my accommodation stuff
- Set up Obsidian and Git instead of Google Docs, with probably continue to use these since I can do it on anything, though mobile will require me to edit the singular files on Github, which will be annoying, 
  -- Worth it for the guaranteed saved on physical devices (except phone)

- Started planning a potential story based around the song Hell's Coming with Me by Poor Man's Poison (Working Title - Raised by Hell)

- Did some work on the Portal Novelisation Chapter 2 (still need to figure out a better title)
