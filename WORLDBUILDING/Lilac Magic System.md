## Ichor.

### The Relic

An object made of Pure Ichor that can theoretically be absorbed by someone, but no one knows exactly how to make it do that.

Lilac absorbed the Relic, which was in the form of a necklace, unintentionally while in an extreme emotional state following the news of her not-girlfriend's death.

The relic completely blocks her vision, replacing it with eyesight that can see Ichor, both Innate and External, though she doesn't realise it at the time.

She spots Iocaiser, though all she sees is a massive amount of Ichor that vanishes in a split second after turning towards her.

The shock of it vanishing distracted her from her climbing/running, and she damages her left eye and leg as she falls down.
