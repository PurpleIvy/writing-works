Based on the song "Hell's coming with me" - Poor Man's Poison




Notes/Plan



Fantasy or realistic? Either could work, write a short version with and one without


Trans girl? Maybe one version of the prologue with one with out.


MC raised in a town with a lot of people, abused and beaten, potentially implied sa by the church leader who is viewed by everyone as a saint.

Kicked out of the town and left for dead on the side of the road.

Survives, and vows to themselves return to pay the devil his dues.



The townspeople are going about their day, and since its quite a small town, when they hear about a war veteran who showed up, bearing medals of honour.

The veteran is glad to talk about their stories, and asks if there is a hotel they can stay at for the day, as their car broke down.

They say there isnt, but then the church leader/mayor mentions there is a room in the church that they have converted into a potential hotel room, for travellers such as them.

The veteran thanks them dearly, giving the mayor a formal military salute, which makes the mayor blush

The veteran and the town mechanic go off to have a look at the car.

Things in the town slowly start to go wrong for everyone since the veteran arrived.

Starting small, then eventually drastically getting more and more drastic.

Like an avalanche of bad things, and the townspeople slowly start to turn on each other as more and more evidence points to the different people causing the issues for others.

A small shop is unable to pay their bills on time and has to close down.

A restaurant/bar's fridge is faulty and their food goes mouldy

Etc etc

Until eventually the preacher is found dead, hung in the town square, with a note at his feet.

He is begging god for forgiveness, and pleads to the townspeople to do the same

The people who come across his body start praying fervently until the veteran arrives.

They all apologise to them for what has happened, but they just start to laugh.

They laugh and laugh, pulling out a pistol and shooting it in the air.

They blame the townspeople, every single one of them, and tells them that they vowed to return that same day, fifteen years ago.

end with the slaughter of the townspeople being implied but not shown.






FANTASY.

MAGIC SYSTEM BASED AROUND THE THEME OF CONTROL, FEAR, AND TRUST.

The more someone fears you, the greater control you have over them.

Control through fear is powerful, but only for a short time, because you end up becoming paranoid about losing your fear.

Loyalty through trust versus fear.

(Figure out what the actual magic part of the system could be, though mindless thralls could be a likely part of it)
