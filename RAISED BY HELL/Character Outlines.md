# Important Characters
## Drifter (Previously known as Laaned)

#### Overview
- Protagonist of the prologue, ultimately the antagonist for the cast of the [[Worldbuilding Outline#Town|Town]], since he aims to destroy not only the dictatorial Mayor, but everyone else along with him, leading to his eventual death
- Manipulative to the Townspeople, but also genuinely helpful to them. He is the kind of person who makes you think you know a lot about him, but he always subtly dodges actually answering any questions.
- Becomes a trusted member of the Town, and helps them as things start to go wrong.
- In his own mind, revenge against everyone has been his number one priority, even higher than his own survival. He wants to make everyone pay for what has been done to him, and likely others since (but mainly him). He takes after his [[Character Outlines#Lord Mayor [Blank|father]] in that way, but 

#### Backstory
- Grew up as the Lord's son, being tormented by him, and everyone in the village hated and feared him for his birth, he just wanted to be liked, but no one granted him the privilege
- He was tormented by his father, until he did something his father considered unforgivable (probably implied to be queerness), and his father forced him to beat himself nearly to death, then made him wander into the middle of the desert, leaving him for dead.
- He vowed to get his revenge on the town who stood by and watched as this happened, but most of all the destroy his father.
- After wandering through the desert for at least a full day, beaten and bruised, the hot sun burning down on him, he came across some people on horseback, who rushed to his aid.

(Possibly change this section, maybe have the people who save him be Deserters from the army, still able to train him, but who adopt him into their banditry group)
- They were part of a military training group, and the general had ordered them to train in the desert, since one of the groups their lord was considering a strike against presided over part of the desert near one of their camps.
- Drifter was confused by the fact that they seemed pleased to follow their captain's orders, not really understanding that not everyone was physically incapable of following orders, as he was against his father.
- The sergeant with the soldiers decides to take the beaten and abandoned Drifter with them, saying that their captain would decide what to do with him, and they tell him to get comfortable, since it will be quite a long journey back to their camp.
- He decides to join up with the army, after watching some of them training, with swords and rapiers, as well as just watching some of them fistfight for fun. (Possibly rework to be slightly more critical of the military industrial complex)
- He genuinely enjoys it there for a time, though starts the see the similarities between the system of the military, and his abusive father, and he never forgot his vow to destroy his town.
- Eventually, after many years of climbing the ranks, he asks for a leave of absence from the Lord's army, citing the "fact" that he found out about his father's coming demise
- The Lord accepted, having seen Drifter in action many times, and knowing how loyal he was, having killed many of the Lord's enemies so that he can control more land.
---

- Drifter eventually returns to his home town, completely unrecognisable, wearing his military outfit with medals of valour.
- The plot of the novel ensues

## Lord Mayor \[Blank]

### Overview

Lord Mayor of the [[Worldbuilding Outline#Town|Town]], he rules over everybody with an iron fist, destroying any potential threats to his power. 

He is an abusive egotist who believes he rules over the town because he is better than everyone, and everyone in the town is terrified of him, with no one daring to challenge him and his orders. He believes he is entitled to anything and everything in the city, and it is an open secret that he sometimes requests certain women he takes a liking to, regardless of whether or not they are married or widowed.

He doesn't even need to manipulate people, since his [[Worldbuilding Outline#Magic|Magic]] allows him to Command people who fear him. The more they fear him, the harder it is for them to disobey his orders, and he used this to build up his power, scaring people into making him mayor.

### Backstory

Rejected from the Royal Court for inappropriate usage of Commands, and exiled to the backwaters of the Cerulean Desert, Lord Mayor \[Blank] bitterly decided to take his anger and frustration out on the people of the [[Worldbuilding Outline#Town|Town]], most notably his wife Iaese and son [[#Drifter (Previously Laaned)|Laaned]].

Many of the people he grew up around hated him, because he was violent and abusive, because his father was also violent and abusive to him, because he believed he didn't get what he was owed. He adopted this mindset in the Royal Court, and many of the women he tried to court refused, even when he attempted to Command them (the act that got him exiled), because most of them were not scared of him, knowing he had no real power against King Tain

People have suffered because of his actions, both directly and indirectly, and all he cares about is the people fearing him so he can keep his power of Commands over them.
