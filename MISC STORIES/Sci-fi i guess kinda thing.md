Cyberpunk kinda thing

Ever since Ena was a teenager she had been sceptical of cyber-enhancements. Part of the reason for this was due to her having a malcontent towards the establishments that were supposedly there to help make things better for the people. She had had many issues dealing with the government and living in the outskirts of Eroi, an area that had been ignored by political figures no matter their policies, certainly hadn’t helped the government gain popularity from Ena. Her strong dislike of the authority figures in her life was not the only reason that Ena was hesitant to get any cyber-enhancements, however. Ena always did what her gut told her to, which was usually why she got in trouble with her parents and her school quite a lot. Ena trusted her gut more than she did almost anyone else in her life, including her own brain. And her gut told her there was something very wrong with injecting yourself with nanites and ripping your arms off to replace them with metal lumps. Obviously Ena’s brain embellished her gut’s feelings a little, but Ena was still certain that something was strange about the technological changes happening to the world. 

This, combined with Ena’s fear and hatred towards authority meant that she when she turned 16 and crossed the legal barrier into getting enhancements, she was one of the relative few 16-year-olds in the whole country to stay fully organic. The majority of those people who stayed organic were those who committed crimes, or were just living in poverty. Despite not living in the best of neighbourhoods, Ena and her family were able to have some money to spend on leisurely activities, especially if they specifically looked for good deals whenever they shopped for food and essentials. They were able to have roughly 100 dollars in spending money for whatever they wished, and both Ena and her parents led rather minimalist lives, and didn’t go out to clubs or bars that often, never, in Ena’s case. That wasn't much money to spend, but it was certainly enough to get a small enhancement to some part of Ena’s body if she wished, which she obviously didn’t. Ena did not want to go to college when she turned 16, however she knew that if she did not go, she would be forced to get a job. One of Ena’s main concerns with getting a job was that more and more jobs were requiring their employees to get certain cyber-enhancements for “health and safety reasons”. Ena’s parents were worried about Ena going to college, as although they stated that they wanted her to go, the only colleges that would be worth her time going to be expensive ones in the city centre. Somewhere that would have been near impossible for Ena to get to and from every day. The solution to this issue came in the form of her school principal visiting Ena’s apartment shortly after she finished her final exams.

“Why are you here Mr Mahona?” Ena was the one to greet David Mahona as he entered the stood by the door of Ena’s family’s apartment.

“Blunt as usual I see Ms Denar, but it's been 2 weeks since you finished your exams and said goodbye to me and the rest of the school? How have you been?” Mr Mahona was used to dealing with Ena a lot, and knew her rather well from all her times in his office. He was one of the few staff members who rarely tried to make it seem like he was in control, which was ironic as he was quite literally the one with the most control. Ena liked him more than she liked all the other staff members because of this, although not by much.

“I’ll be a lot better once you’ve told my why you are here.” 

“Are your parents around? I’m sure they would love to hear what I have to tell say.”

“They’re both working”

“Ah, I see. Might I know when one of them might be back? Because if it is quite soon then if it is alright with you, I would rather stay here than in my car.”

“Couple of hours at least, so I'm the only audience for your news”

“*Meowww*” Ena’s cat Spot, so named for the white spot on the tip of her tail, meowed immediately after that last comment from Ena, as if trying to say that she was also interested in the news from Principal Mahona. Ena quickly scooped up the cat to stop it from walking out the still open door and through Mahona’s legs.

“Very well. I have a letter for you from Stalthorn College, a rather prestigious college that has had many successful graduates become Lawyers, Army Generals, Politicians and more.”

“I never applied to Stalthorn, and what makes you think that telling me about those careers from there would make me any more likely to want to apply there?”

“Perhaps *you* never applied there, but that doesn't mean that someone else didn’t apply for you,” Mahona paused for a second noticing Ena’s frown, “The staff at our school, and any school for that matter, are allowed to apply to a college on a student’s behalf if the school is unaware of any apprenticeship or employment that is being sought out by said student. In this case, as I know you and know that you would find a way to do what you wanted to do whether anyone else agreed with it or not, I decided to apply you to Stalthorn, as if they didn't accept you, you planned to not be accepted to any college anyway, and if they did, then you will be able to avoid getting a job for a few more years.”  

“What does the letter say?” Ena replied, unable to disagree with some of the points Mahona made

“I think you should read it for yourself.” As Mahona said this he extended his arm forwards allowing Ena to take the letter from Stalthorn.

“Fine.” 

Ena took the letter and unrolled it so that she could read it.
