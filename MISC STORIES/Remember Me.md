Remember Me

Seren steadied herself, then gently placed her hand on the chest in front of her. They reminded her of someone, but she couldn’t place exactly who. She put it out of her mind, focussing on the wound. As she thought about it, the bloody slash sparked into a small, cold black flame, before slowly sewing back together again, starting to reform to its original state. She checked the time, they likely wouldn’t wake up for a couple of hours yet. Provided their metabolism wasn’t altered by the flames, as had occasionally happened with some patients. She could feel the episode coming on, and started towards her quarters, stumbling as she went. She entered the room and immediately realised she couldn't hold it in any longer. Her last thought before she succumbed to it was “oh, shorter than last time.” 

The black flame took a heavy toll on her psyche, but it was worth it, to help heal people. She hadn’t expected this person's wounds to hurt this much, however. Clearly she had underestimated how hurt they had been. She could feel her flame getting stronger as her thoughts started to spiral, so as much as it hurt her to, she allowed it to happen.

Within minutes, Seren curled up into a fetal position, covering herself with her duvet. She clung on to it like a vice as she glanced around the room desperately trying to find somewhere to hide from a person who should have been dead. Her breathing spiked and, as she got more and more frantic, she could hear a faint little voice in her head trying to help calm her down. She ignored it. 

She had no sense of time when these episodes occurred, but she had hoped she would recover before the man woke up. When her door opened and she clambered under her bed, knocking things over as she went, part of her knew she had been too hopeful. Her eyes darted around under the bed at light speed, and fell upon a slightly dust covered envelope, with “PATIENT” written on it in expertly drawn cursive letters. She threw the envelope out towards the open door, praying to any number of gods that they would read it and leave. She could hear a voice calling out to her, but it was so hard to tell where it was coming from, let alone what the words were saying. They were simultaneously deafening in her ears and as silent as the night. 

A cloaked figure stood there, their demonic looking shadow stretching and warping across the floor from the bright lights of the surgery room, reaching across the floor towards the bed Seren was under, trying to drag her out, until... The door slowly closed, and she was alone once again petrified with the fear that they would return. She stayed there, silently panting, under the bed until she passed out from exhaustion. 

Seren woke up in her chair, and after checking the time, found it odd that she wasn’t all that hungry. It hadn’t happened again, had it? She opened her fridge, and found things that should have been there missing. Apparently between her episode and now she had made herself some food and simply forgotten. That would have concerned her in the past, but she was used to it by this point. Now it just annoyed her. She returned to her desk, and was glad to see that she had also gotten some paperwork done too, regarding her last patient. 

She tried recalling what they had looked like, but her memories were all blacked out, as if something was physically blocking her, so in the hopes of retaining at least some amount of sanity, she stopped trying to. Hopefully they had given her some money at least. She remembered that they looked kind and… remorseful? A little voice told her that they looked like someone she knew all too well. She ignored it. 

She walked over to the payment tin attached to the wall and opened it up. Inside was a small amount of money from previous patients, along with a small handwritten note in mostly legible cursive. Seren’s eyes widened in shock as she read the letter.   
“Dear Miss Serenity Fyr,  
Deepest apologies, but I believed it best if I warned you of my return, I shall be back tomorrow in order to talk to you properly.  
Kindest Regards, Death”

A little voice told her to let herself read the name*. I can’t.* She reread the letter multiple times, the signing at the bottom becoming no clearer, so she ignored it, and focussed on the rest. They were coming back later today. Seren looked at the time. It was 3 o’clock in the morning. She had plenty of time. Was it enough time to pack up and run? No, probably not, she had done that a couple of times before, but it usually took the whole day to pack up her medical equipment, and she needed to go back to sleep at some point, she could feel her strength still recovering after her episode. She had no choice. She had to stay and face them. The scars on her cheek from the last time a patient returned started to sting and her anxiety increased, but a part of her knew this time would be different. It terrified her anyway. She decided to clean up the rest of the surgical suite, apparently she hadn’t done *that* during her bout of amnesia, only cooking, a small amount of paperwork, and for some reason reading part of a book she remembered vehemently disliking. She barely even noticed when she finished cleaning and returned to bed, falling asleep almost as soon as her head hit the pillow.

Seren woke up to a banging at her door. She immediately remembered the message from the previous night and fear paralysed her. She checked her doorbell from her phone, noting the time as being roughly mid-day as she did so. All she saw was the delivery driver for the packages she had… apparently ordered during one of her many memory blanks. Unfortunately for Seren, the person arrived soon after the delivery driver. She first heard a crow squawking at her door, yet as soon as she opened it, she saw the foot of their cloak. She closed the door, and they completely vanished from her mind, enough for her to open the door again, when they knocked on the door. A voice urged her to ignore the knocking. She opened the door.. 

All her mind would let her see in front of her door was a blur. Her vision was working perfectly fine, everything around the person was in perfect vision. The only thing that wasn’t clear, was them. Despite this, she thought it impolite to not invite them in for a drink of whatever they liked, apparently aged tea, and sit him down on her sofa.

Seren sat opposite their visitor. A very loud voice in her head was screaming at her. She ignored it.

“Miss Fyr, I thank you for healing me, I am rather clumsy in my old age.”  
The words hit her ears. They sounded like words she knew and understood, in an order she understood them, yet still her mind would not allow her to process what was happening directly in front of her.

“I’m sorry, I didn’t catch that.”

Voices from all directions screamed at her to listen to what was being said. Her mind still refused. She just nodded in the hopes they would stop talking and leave.

“I came here wanting to apologise to you, and, well… I tripped up the stairs, accidentally slicing myself on my own cane.” They chuckled. “I still need to get more used to this, despite my years I have not done a lot of exploring. Regardless, you saw me some number of years ago, at least for you. I have felt guilty ever since, but I wanted to get used to my job before returning, I knew I would have plenty of time.”

Seren’s vision started to blur, her head getting dizzy, as she found it harder and harder to stay focussed on what was happening in front of her, only the occasional word passing through the blockage in her mind..

All Seren could do was hope for an opening, to let her run away and hide. The voices pleaded at her to remember them. The person in front of her apologised for their prior inexperience a couple more times before stopping, and just watching her. They sighed, noticing the expression on Seren’s face. 

”I caused this pain you experience. I remember being human, though it was quite some time ago at this point. Experiences that stick with you. I hoped my appearance did not hurt you, but that appears to have been wishful thinking. I believe I could potentially remove those memories of yours, though it may be quite risky.”

“No. The pain will morph and change, but it *will* gradually weaken. Ser- I will eventually remember you, when I am ready to. Until then, something will continue to stop me.”

The words came from Seren’s mouth, though she was certain she did not speak them. A voice louder than any other told Seren that for now,  it was okay to hide. She listened to the voice.
