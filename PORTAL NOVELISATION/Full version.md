## Chapter 1

“**Hello, and again, welcome to the Aperture Science Computer Aided Enrichment Centre**.” 

The monotonous voice spoke out as soon as Chell opened her eyes, sitting up in the glass suspension chamber she had been sleeping in. How long had it been? Chell couldn't remember. Though there was no mirror in sight to tell for certain, Chell looked down at her body, unable to see any visible change. 

She looked around her surroundings as the voice continued on, something about being processed for testing? The clear glass panels surrounding her kept her boxed in, and there was seemingly no exit to the room. There was a toilet that Chell decided it would be a good idea not to use, considering there was a viewing deck on the wall to the right of her bed, just outside the glass, with a working security camera on the wall next to it, its red light beaming down on her. A small radio was placed on the desk next to the toilet, humming a pleasant tune that brightened Chell's mood slightly. The final thing in the room that Chell noticed was a timer on the one wall not made out of glass, counting down from one minute, currently at 20 seconds. 

“**...and learning are the primary goals of all enrichment centre activities, serious injury may occur. For your own safety, and the safety of others, please refrain from— Por favor bord˜n de fellar. Muchos gracias de fellar gracias..**”

The voice glitched out, Chell unable to understand what happened to it, though able to tell that something had gone wrong with the safety announcement. She didn't mind too much, she wanted the announcement to be over with anyway, but that did not fill her with much hope for the tests she was apparently supposed to be performing from now on. She glanced back at the viewing room, thinking that someone might have come to check on her. The camera followed her as she moved around trying to get an angle to see someone. No one appeared. She sighed, presuming that it was just a one time glitch, and that the rest of the tests would probably be fine.

“**Stand back. The portal will open in 3\. 2\. 1\.**”

As the voice and timer finished their countdowns in sync with each other, there was a slight fizzling noise, and the wall below the timer erupted in an orange glow that instantly grew into an oval shape about two meters tall, and one wide. As Chell watched this glowing shape appear from seemingly nowhere, it vanished, being replaced by… nothing. Or rather, the wall itself was gone, and she could walk through it. Looking through the space, she could see herself, from a wall that she could just barely see in the corner of her vision, outside the confines of the glass room. She turned to her right, seeing if she could see herself there, and sure enough, there she was. 

Chell slowly inched her fingers towards the sizzling doorway with an orange glow that had spontaneously opened up, then hesitated, and turned towards the desk behind her. She picked up the radio, which was still humming its peaceful, upbeat tune, and walked back to the doorway. She stood in front of it, feet itching in the oddly designed shoes she had woken up in, and gently tossed the radio through the doorway. It landed on the ground in front of her with a crash. It *also* landed to the side of her, just outside the glass wall, and in front of the other doorway, this one with a blue glow around it. She presumed that it was, in fact, safe to travel through these doorways, and that the safety instructions hadn’t missed out any crucial information. This helped calm her nerves slightly, and she picked up the radio, checking for any scratches on it. 

She glanced to her right, a giant LED sign taking up the length of the entire wall, reading “00” in a giant font, and beneath it a small counter currently reading “00/19.” Chell smiled upon seeing this, as it seemed to imply that once she was completed with all 19 tests, she should be able to leave, wherever that may take her. She left the sign, walking around the room on the only path she could. A small walkway that took her around the outside of the glass room she had woken up in. She wondered when she had been moved to the glass room, since she hadn’t remembered waking up there. Thinking about it, there wasn't a lot that she could remember from before waking up. This worried her, but she tried to calm herself down by saying that she hasn't been awake for that long, and was probably asleep for quite some time. It's probably only natural to be a bit disorientated after waking up from one of those suspension chambers.

Chell quickly approached a circular door with a split in the center, its two halves whirred as they slid open in opposite directions as she got near it. Beyond the door she could see a perfectly clean, white room, with yet another viewing deck. This one, just like the last, was empty. There were two more notable sights in the room, alongside an exit door. The first was a large red button fixed to the floor, and the second was a large metal tube affixed to the ceiling in the furthest corner away from Chell. As Chell stepped into the room, the doors behind her slammed shut with a metallic thud, and would not reopen, even after Chell hesitantly placed her hand on it, accidentally dropping the radio on the floor as she did so. She decided to leave it there for now. 

The door closing shut and not reopening led Chell to only one conclusion, that if she wanted to leave this place she would need to complete the tests, or get someone from the viewing decks to let her out. If they ever turned up, at least.

She returned to surveying the room she was now stuck in, sneaking a glance at the viewing deck in the hopes she could catch a hint of someone watching her. She saw no one. She looked across the room, and decided the most sensible course of action for the time being was to step on the button, just to see what it does. She stood on it, and an LED beneath it started to glow, as the door on the other side of the room opened up. Chell stepped off the button, heading towards the now open door. The second she removed her foot from the button, the door slammed shut. Chell sighed, giving a small glare at the camera positioned slightly above the door, and went to stand back on the button. Before she reached it, however, she heard a metallic clang, and the tube opened up, with a large cube dropping down from above. Despite its size, the cube only made a light thud as it hit the ground. Chell looked over, but ignored it for now, moving back to the entrance door, and leaning over to pick up the radio she had dropped. She had already guessed what would be needed to solve the test, but wanted to see what would happen anyway. Chell dropped the still humming radio on the button. Nothing happened.

Disappointed but not surprised, Chell nudged the radio off the button with her foot and walked over to the cube. It was about a meter in each direction, up to Chell's thighs, and she decided to gently push it with her palm. While it didn’t move *easily*, the cube still moved along the path her arm was guiding it. Leaning down to pick up the cube, she found it was rather uncomfortable to hold given its dimensions, and quickly moved back towards the button. The door whirred open as Chell stood on it, cube in her arms, and she slowly stepped off the button, leaving the cube on top of it. The door stayed open. 

As Chell started to walk towards it, she was surprised by the monotonous robotic voice speaking out.

“**Excellent. Please move quickly to the chamber lock after completing each test.**”

Chell complied with the voice's request, correctly assuming the chamber lock was through the only way she could go. As she reached the door, she could see what looked to be a white circular elevator, and just before the entrance to it was an extremely thin transparent field, blue lasers shooting across from two objects attached to opposite facing walls. Before Chell could even think about what this might be, the voice continued.

“**First, however, note the Incandescent Particle Field across the exit. This Aperture Science Material Emancipation Grill will vaporise any unauthorised materials that pass through it. For instance, the Aperture Science Weighted Storage Cube.**”

Chell looked back at the cube, having been careful not to walk too far and be locked out. It sat stationary on the button, weighing it down and keeping the door open for her. She walked back to the button, and the radio that sat on the ground to the side of it. She picks up the radio, adjusting the volume slightly as she had accidentally increased it when she moved it off the button. She gently repeated the action of throwing it a few inches in the air and catching it as she walked towards the exit and the… what had the voice called it? Emancipation Grid? Particle Field?

The grid emitted a very quiet sizzling noise as Chell approached it. The voice had said it would vaporise unauthorised objects. Was she authorised? She assumed so, it would be quite difficult to continue the tests if she was not. Despite the logical assumption she had made for why it would not happen, Chell was still concerned about disintegrating. What certainly didn't help her fears was that the particle field in front of her started sizzling much more aggressively as her hand, still holding the radio, inched up to it.

Much like with the doorway from before, Chell decided to test the safety of the technology in front of her with the radio. Chell braced herself, closing her eyes and taking in a deep breath. She caressed the radio, then hesitantly gave it a quick kiss, before tossing it across the field towards the elevator beyond it.

The peaceful humming immediately cut short as the radio disintegrated into near nothingness, only a very small pile of ash remaining, scattering across the ground with the same momentum she had tossed the radio with. An electrical sound that Chell couldn't quite make out before over the sound of the radio's singing. It clung to Chell's ears as she backed away from the pulsing particle field, seemingly coming from outside of the room. She tried to focus on that sound as she walked straight into the now permanently shut door, only a few feet away from the vaporisation field.

Chell was hyperventilating given the situation, and was just barely able to look up. She noticed a security camera facing directly at her, its red light blinking with almost every breath. They were watching her. Whoever was running this place, at least. Chell's breathing became steadier as she stared at the camera, her eyebrows furrowing. Her eyes remained fixed.

Chell pointedly looked away from the camera, and walked towards the particle field with a newfound resolve. She stopped just in-front of it, closing her eyes. She took in one deep breath, filling her lungs to the brim with oxygen. Then, trying not to show the camera her fear, she stepped forward.

Nothing happened. Or rather, she wasn't vaporised. Her foot landed on the ground on the other side easily, and the rest of her quickly followed suit. She looked back at the field, this time from the other side, and, seeing the camera in her peripheral vision, tried to suppress her laughter. She had really been petrified of that? Chell turned away, walking into the elevator in front of her, as the doors closed behind her, and she rose to the next text chamber.

End of [[Chapter 1]]


## Chapter 2

Chell felt like grabbing her ears and holding them shut at the elevator whirred up the facility with a metallic screech akin to a banshee. Fortunately for her, the elevator came to a stop rather quickly, and she was able to avoid listening to the scratching sound for any longer. She assumed it would return with the next elevator, though of course held out hope that there would be some maintenance staff able to oil the sides of the elevator in time. She recalled the viewing decks from the previous test chamber. She thought to herself that surely one of them would have evidence of a researcher there. Surely. Before she could finish her thought, the elevator doors whirred open, creating a noise far kinder on the ears than the elevator itself was, giving Chell a much needed break.

As soon as the doors opened, Chell could hear a now very familiar sound to her, the peppy, cheerful humming music that had accompanied her throughout most of the previous test chamber. Though she was unable to see the radio that was the source of the humming, she could already feel herself growing less anxious, and more excited to see what would happen in the next text. She stepped forwards out of the elevator, and was greeted with a massive LED sign, identical to the previous one, only the text now read “01/19.” She looked at the bottom of the sign, and noticed some things that she hadn’t before, now that she was paying more attention to the sign. There were 10 logos along the bottom middle, though it was quite hard for her to make out what each of them were, since they were not lit up like the rest of the sign. She also noticed the Aperture Laboratories logo in the bottom corner. Was the last one… cake? She thought to herself that that sounded rather nice as a reward for going through nineteen of these test chambers. 

What caught her attention the most, however, was not on the sign itself, but on the wall to the right of it. Seemingly coming down from the roof, she could see damp spots dripping down the top two panels. Chell tried to reach up and touch the darker patch on the wall, a potentially unwise decision, but she was unable to reach it, for it was too high up the wall. She relaxed herself, pointedly ignoring the damp wall, telling herself that the maintenance staff were probably going to fix the elevator and that at the same time. This helped mildly ease her fears, though they still remained in the back of her head as she focused on looking at the actual test chamber in front of her.

She walked away from the concerningly darkened wall, past the LED sign, to what seemed like a ledge that she would need to jump down in order to complete the test. The ledge appeared to be about the same height as the damp spot on the wall was, so Chell assumed she would be unable to return to the elevator. Given the elevator's proximity to the possible mouldy wall, she didn’t entirely mind that possibility.

She held on to the right side wall and what little support it provided as she leaned over the edge to survey the test area, Before she could get a good look at the testing area, however, right in front of Chell’s face was a security camera, like from the previous chamber, only this one had the radio perched on top of it, seemingly perfectly balanced to avoid falling off, though she knew the radio wouldn’t break from that given her repeated drops of her last radio. Chell smiled as she went to grab the radio, but then hesitated, pulling her hand away.

She wondered why the radio was perched in this specific spot, out of the view of the camera. Did someone place it here? If so, who could have done it? And when? She considered, unwillingly, that she might have to leave the radio behind. She was surprised at how disappointed she felt at the thought, then decided she would choose what to do after looking across the test chamber.

Chell could see a large empty room directly below the ledge she was leaning over, about one panel down, that was blocked off on each side by glass panels. Through the panel on her right, that she could only see through by moving around the camera in her face, Chell was able to see a single solitary storage cube. The rectangular shaped room that held the cube was seemingly completely inaccessible, with no entrances nor exits in sight. Chell turned around to face the opposite side of the room, a complete mirrored reflection, with one notable exception. As opposed to the isolated cube that was placed in the room on the right, the room on the left housed a single, big, red button, placed neatly on the floor just ahead of the end wall.

She turned to the walled off area directly in front of her, and rather unsurprisingly, saw the exit there. She did, however, make a note of the fact that there was a viewing deck, looking out over the exit, and *most* of the test chamber, with the security camera facing the rest. Chell turned around to the damp and potentially mouldy wall for a brief moment, before looking back at the exit, making certain the radio was secure on her orange jumpsuit, and jumping down.

She landed with a thud, but was surprised that she barely felt the impact at all, though she admitted it wasn't that much of a fall. As she landed, the voice spoke out again, seemingly coming from everywhere, despite no visible speakers anywhere in the test chamber. Chell was getting used to the monotonous, robotic tone of the voice that would likely be guiding her through the test chambers, and while she wasn't exactly pleased to hear it again, it didn't grate against her like the elevator had.

**Please place the Weighted Storage cube on the Weighted Storage Cube on the Fifteen Hundred Megawatt Aperture Science Heavy Duty Super-Colliding Super Button.**

The voice said nothing more, and Chell guessed that it was a collection of pre-recorded messages with certain responses for if she took certain actions. Chell took out the radio, fiddling with the audio, as two gateways opened up. An orange one directly beneath the ledge she had been standing on, and the blue one in the room with the button. She placed the radio on the ground, and walked through the door, assuming she would still be able to hear it from the other side of the glass. She noticed that she was right, as she walked towards the button. 

Chell stepped onto the button, turning behind her to see the door open up. She only saw it in her peripheral vision, however, as the main focus of her eyesight was the solid wall that was now placed in front of her. The one she had just walked through in order to access the room. Chell sat down on the button, her head spinning. She might be trapped. Had she messed up this seemingly easy test somehow? Someone would come help her if she *was* trapped, wouldn't they? She tried to focus on the radio's humming, looking towards it for support. As if it could hear her, the volume of the song had reach a trough, just long enough for Chell to hear the high pitched fizzling of the doorway seemingly closing and reopening. 

She glanced towards the direction of the noise, to see the blue gateway appear in the room with the cube for a few seconds, before fizzling out again, re-materialising with a slightly higher pitched noise in the room with Chell. She scrambled to her feet and ducked towards the gateway, managed to get through just a fraction before it closed. She slid on the ground, hurting her palms and knees, but she was safe and back in the open room she had jumped down to. Chell turned to face the orange gateway, but didn't dare to step through it yet. She watched as the space behind it changed with that same fizzling noise, now showing the room with a cube. Cube, Button, Exit. Cube, Button, Exit. Chell watched the pattern repeat a couple more times for good measure, then walked through the doorway once it swapped to show the cube. It shut behind her as she reached the cube, but she felt less anxious now. It was going to return, she knew that now.

Realistically, given the pattern, her spiral had only lasted a few seconds, since she returned through the portal the second it returned. She knew that, though she still felt embarrassed at having done that in front of the camera. She would have to keep herself composed next time. People were watching her, after all. The blinking red light on the camera that followed her told her all that she needed to know. Even if the viewing decks were seemingly always empty, at the very least *someone* was watching her.  

She picked up the cube, and walked towards the doorway, her thoughts taking up enough time for the portal to return. She chucked the cube through, weighing the same amount as it had in the last chamber, and it landed with a metallic thud in the open room, though accidentally hitting the radio and sending it sliding across the room with a scraping sound. She swiftly followed the cube through the gateway, not wanting to find out what happens if it swaps locations while she remains inside of it. 

Chell picked up and dusted off the humming radio, which was seemingly unperturbed by its sudden relocation, and placed it on the ground beside the gateway, as she waited for a full cycle of the pattern, before sending the cube and herself through to the large red button. She placed the cube on the button, proud of herself for managing to get through the test despite her earlier difficulties. She expected the voice to say something upon completion, as it had in the previous test, so was unsurprising to hear it return.

**"Perfect. Please move quickly to the chamberlock, as the effects of prolonged exposure to the Button are not part of this test."**

Chell considered staying with the cube anyway, despite the apparent unknown effects it might cause, but decided against doing so. She wanted to get out of this test chamber as quickly as possible so she could make sure to figure out how to complete the next one, whatever that may be. So she waited for another cycle of the gateways, passing through to the main area with the radio, picking it up and taking it out with her as she re-entered the portal, this time below the viewing deck, facing the exit.

As she passed through, the radio in her hand started to spit out static, the cheerful humming growing quieter and quieter until only the static remained. Chell tried fiddling with the buttons on it, and the radio started screaming out some beeps, far louder than the humming had been. Beep beep pause beep pause beep beep. It continued for what felt like a few minutes until it relaxed for a few moments. Then it started up again, beeping the same beeps over and over again, as if trying to send Chell a message. She wondered whether the radio itself was the one trying to talk to her, but discarded that possibility almost instantly, that would be highly unlikey, why would there be a sentient metal radio in the room she woke up in. No, she decided that someone, somewhere, was trying to send her a message. Unfortunately for the mystery messenger, Chell did not know morse could, and as she was trying to remember the message, she kept forgetting parts of the message. She glanced at the blinking red light of the camera, pointing straight at her, and decided to continue through the tests. The person sending her this message was likely not the same one behind the camera, and Chell hoped that this person would try to find a different way of sending her a message if they were truly desperate.

Chell walked up to the emancipation grill, but hesitated before passing through it. She had already discarded the possibility that the radio itself was sentient, and trying to send her a message. But what if she was wrong? Did she really want to disintegrate a potentially sentient creature? She placed the radio on the ground with a gentle kiss, putting it down just before the emancipation grill, and entered the elevator to leave to the next test chamber. She could hear the humming of the radio getting quieter as she rose, but it still helped to make the grating sound of the elevator less painful to her ears.




CHAPTER 2 notes

Chell goes up the elevator which is surprisingly fast, with a scraping metal noise as it goes up.

She arrives at Chamber 01 with a sign that is buzzing, at the bottom the sign has the aperture laboratories logo on it/

She is required to jump down a ledge, and would seemingly be unable to climb back up.

She can see three other sections of the room as she walks up to the ledge, blocked by glass panes.

Through the one directly in front of her she can see a viewing deck, as well as the exit. The viewing deck is empty.

On the left she can see a button, and on the right she can see a cube.

There is a camera slightly above the ledge she is standing on, just barely within reach

On top of it she is surprised to find a radio

She has to jump up to grab it almost losing her footing and falling off the ledge (she doesnt)

It's playing the same peppy song as before

She decides to take it with her, and reluctantly jumps down the ledge, glaring at the camera above.

Completes the test chamber (getting stuck in one of the rooms and having to wait for the portal to come back to the room in order to leave.)

She takes the radio with her and hears the morse code/static

Glados says her line about the effects of prolonged exposure to the button not being part of the test, and Chell refuses to leave, at least for the time being, though quickly realises there isnt anything she can do yet, and leaves

And then chamber 02, ending with the portal gun
