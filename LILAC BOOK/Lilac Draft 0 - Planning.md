*LILAC PLAN*

*Chapter Overviews and Reasonings*

Act 1

Prologue

Prologue overview and outline

- As it is now, I think the story needs to start when Lilac meets White in hospital in the centre of Aureole.  
- Set up for Lilac’s character, her motives and reasons.   
- Set up the worldbuilding, the magic, the tech, the locations.  
- Set up themes. Have Lilac actively trying to climb from one side of the Split to the other, contrasting with her eventual climb to the top of Iocaiser’s Skyscraper.  
- Also set up the mystery and intrigue surrounding how the magic really works, and the fact that Lilac was being watched by someone, later revealed to be White after his Vampirism is revealed.  
- Start with action compared to Lilac’s meeting with White which will be character based, with White being a manipulator with his own reasons for bringing Lilac into this, with the hidden knowledge that she acquired had his family heir

Chapter 1

Chapter 1 Overview and Outline 

- Lilac wakes up in Aureole, the city centre. It's far cleaner and shinier than the Split, where she grew up. Her bed sticks out from the rest of the room like a sore thumb, her long black hair trailing down the bed to her legs.  
- The androids who work on her all look nearly identical, though have noticeably different voices, and some have different clothes.  
- The humans who work with the androids all have the same implants, a single eye replacement, in the color of the company they work for's logo.   
- White is her first visitor, already in the room before she awakes, he doesn't look worried for her, but he *does* look worried.  
- When she and him talk, he rarely answers any of her questions, and when he does he always gives vague answers, turning the question back to her.  
- He looks pleased at the end of his (essentially) interrogation of her, leaving and giving her to opportunity to find him if she wants to do something far greater than diving off a balcony in the Strip.  
- Lilac wonders how he knows about what landed her in the hospital, but before she can think too much her surgeon comes in.  
- The surgeon looks completely human, unchanged and unaltered, just like White. (Staying human is a privilege of the wealthy)  
- He tells her that her right eye should be fully fine, yet is completely unresponsive  
- ~~He “recommends” she replace her working eye for the chance of making up the difference, but that she doesn't really have a choice in the matter, and that if she passes the Mana proficiency test then she will be selected for the eye replacement.~~  
- ~~He also tells her that the material they will make her replacement leg out of is quite a rare material called “Telenium”, and that it responds extremely well to Energy/Mana/Unnamed~~  
- ~~He leaves her to soak in the details of what he said as she goes back to sleep~~  
- He informs her about the implant in her eye, and that it uses precise Ichor manipulation in order to utilise all the features of it  
- He also tells her that the material her replacement leg is made of it called Telenium, and is very rare, and she should be thankful that white managed to save some for her.

Chapter 2

Chapter 2 Overview and Outline

- Lilac thanks the staff for bringing her breakfast, and checks the time.   
- She waits until she is certain that her mother is out of the house, and calls her older sister  
- Her sister is glad to hear from her, but is annoyed that she didn't come home the previous night.  
- Lilac apologises, and hesitantly explains why she couldn’t, and that she will probably be away for a week or so.  
- Chrys/Rhys (Chrysanthemum) is visibly worried about her, but says nothing about it.   
- Lilac changes the subject, hobbling over to the window, showing the view to Rhys, and she gives a very different answer to Lilac when White asked her what she thought.  
- This prompts her to start thinking about him and his offer, as well as what it means, though she says nothing about him to Rhys.  
- Lilac asks Rhys to cover for her, and there is the impression that she has had to do this a lot before, but never this bad.  
- Rhys agrees regardless, though, and Lilac thanks her.  
- They hang up, and its clear that they really care for each other, even if they have issues with each other.  
- ~~Lilac thinks more on White's offer, and him in general, as she goes through the tests for her new implants.~~  
- ~~She passes the tests with flying colours, and is selected for the eye and leg replacements.~~  
- ~~She doesn't know exactly how she wants to feel about it. Last time she tried to get an implant was when she was 16, and she was refused because the surgeon knew her mother and didn't want to get on her bad side.~~  
- ~~She goes through with it anyway, not really having a choice in the matter, but also not actively looking to get out of it.~~  
- ~~She decides to try and find White after her surgery, having thought about it all day, and she goes under the scalpel.~~

Chapter 4

Chapter 4 Overview and Outline

- Lilac finally decides to test out her new toys now that she has told her sister she will still be away for a while, and is in recovery for a day after her surgery while they monitor for any potential rejections..  
- She uses mana to control what is essentially a computer screen in her vision.  
- She is able to scan people who are registered to a specific database, and it allows her to see information about them. She can also measure distances, and scan objects and stuff.  
- She doesn't really like it, but she can see uses for it.  
- She also tests out her new leg. Its currently in the form of a leg, and she tries to bend it, but it does nothing. She floods it with Energy and it reacting to it and morphing to the position she wanted it to be in.  
- She accidentally makes her leg too long, and it slams into the end of her bed. She returns it to its original state by removing all the Energy from it.   
- She decides she'll need to practise using it more, but doesn't have the time at the moment.  
- She gets up from her bed and leaves to find White.   
- She walks around the hospital for a while, talking to people and asking about him.  
- The people she talks to seem to have a very different impression of who he is as a person than the one he presented to her  
- She questions whether either of them are the real him.  
- She eventually finds him on the roof, and slowly makes her way over to him, her metallic leg limply dragging along  
- He makes a comment about her eye suiting her, and thrusts an arm out towards her, infusing the leg with his own Energy, allowing her to walk with it as he bends her knee when she needs to.  
- She looks out over the edge of the building to the city below.   
- She couldn’t notice before, but her new eye allows her to zoom in, and some of the buildings are floating, with people walking underneath them, laughing and chatting to each other, seemingly unaware of the hundred ton building above their heads.  
- White says that its because they trust the technology with their lives.   
- She also sees a building hovering above the rest, a massive colourful palace, with a structure beneath it.  
- White explains its even more impressive inside, and that it is owned by a family that has lived in the city for over a couple of centuries, and were fundamental to funding the development of technologies, including the Telenium that makes up Lilac's replaced leg  
- He says they are the only people who are able to create permanent objects with their Energy, and that no one knows how they do it.  
- He says they bring the palace down to the ground once a month to visit the people and show everyone they care, and distribute some of their created materials to the citizens.  
- Lilac continues saying that the leftovers make their way to the Split, and White confirms.  
- Traversal through the Deadlands is uncommon, typically only done by Hunters, due to the high concentration of monsters, animals and creatures adapted to Energy usage.  
- He says that the Agencies classify monsters according to the city regulations, but stops talking, telling her that none of that would be relevant to her unless she takes him up on his offer  
- He offers to hire Lilac at his small Hunting Agency there in Aureole, and let her hunt monsters to her hearts content, as well as to personally train her to use Energy more efficiently.  
- Lilac is shocked, but her first question is about her family.  
- White says that he can provide them with funds to live if they wish for it, and that they would be given the option to move to Aureole.  
- Lilac thinks for a bit, looking out over the city, and apologises, saying she needs some time to think it over and make a decision.  
- White agrees, allowing her to have space, and asks her if she wishes to return home now, or get a shuttle in a few days.  
- Lilac says now, but is confused, until White smirks, placing a hand on her shoulder, and telling her to close her eyes (correcting himself to eye)  
- When Lilac reopens them, she is standing on the balcony she leaped off of in the prologue, with White nowhere to be seen.

Chapter 5  
Chapter 5 Overview.

- Another short White chapter  
- He starts the chapter talking to TeVo in the Deadlands as he is fighting against some monsters.  
- TeVo asks him if Lilac not immediately accepting his offer was a part of his plan, and White replies that it would have been nice, but he didn’t expect it to be that easy just yet.  
- He is confident that she will accept, and mentions he gave her a way to contact him, letting her know about her eye implant’s call function.  
- TeVo stays silent, but White requests for him to speak his mind.  
- Tevo answers that he is unsure how he feels about this, but knows that their objective is too important.  
- White agrees, saying the Beige probably feels the same way as him.  
- TeVo mentions that he is rather annoyed that she is required, but White says she’s too skilled a tool not to use, assuming she accepts.  
- TeVo reluctantly accepts, though scolds White’s phrasing, saying that humans aren’t just tools to be used.  
- White snaps back at him, saying he knows that, which was why he did what he could to help TeVo experience emotions.  
- TeVo stays silent.  
- White angrily beats up a few more monsters, notably never killing any of them until this point, after which he snaps out of his anger, apologising to TeVo, agreeing with him, and hanging up the call.  
- He places a much gentler hand on the corpse of the monster he just killed and produces a faint orb of Energy/Mana, as he warps away, leaving the corpse behind with its family.   
- He warps back to his safehouse, checking for a message from Beige, and sees a response.  
- Beige mentions how desperate White must be to call for her, something which he scoffs at, and she mentions TeVo, asking about “how that clanker is doing”  
- White decides not to mention this to TeVo, but burn the message in his fireplace with a smile.

- She tries walks around the small flat for a bit with her new leg, eventually stopping and returning it to just a peg leg stump as she stands still.   
- She stands out on the balcony, peering down into the ravine of the Split, and the bustling street below.   
- She looks in the direction of where she thinks she came from, Aureole, the city centre.   
- It's hard to get your geographical bearings in the Split, unless its related to the Split’s own geography, which is also complicated if you aren't used to it  
- Chrys wakes up, hearing noises, and assumes it's her mom, but upon realising it's Lilac runs and hugs her, before looking at her new appearance.  
- Lilac assumes she'll think it looks awful, but Chrys loves it.  
- Chrys asks when Lilac got back, and she replies it was only about an hour before, and that she wanted to say good morning before getting some rest.  
- Lilac's eye notices something around Chrys's neck, a necklace made of part Iocaite and part Varinum   
- Lilac asks where she got it, and Chrys says she didn't remember, probably just a gift from a friend.  
- Lilac’s eye has a pop-up, saying there is a 30% chance that Chrys is lying.  
- Lilac ignores the pop-up, believing her sister, but thinks about her eye, and is confused as to why it did nothing like this around White.

- Chrys finds it fascinating, and the two spend time just talking about it and each other.  
- Chrys eventually asks Lilac what she had been dreading to answer. Why she left the way she did when she did.  
- Lilac freezes, having thought a lot about how to answer.  
- She asks whether Chrys remembers Lilac's old friend Lusiae.   
- Lilac mentions that they didn't just stop talking to each other for no reason, but that Lusiae was kidnapped for some reason a few years ago and it was kept extremely quiet, with almost no one knowing about it.  
- Lilac continues, saying that she found out Lusiae's mother had been blackmailed into silence until a couple of days ago where she recieved a letter that Lilac produces from her vest   
- Chrys reads the letter, which contains a Death Certificate and explanation of something about tainted blood, with miniscule financial compensation.  
- Lilac says that she was at Lusiae's mother's house, when she saw the letter, and got so incredibly angry that she just ran, trying to find whoever it was that killed Lusiae.  
- Chrys asks how Lilac is feeling now, and she dodges the question.  
- Before Chrys can say anything more, their mom returns home, and Lilac begs Chrys not to say anything about it yet, 

Chapter 7

Chapter 7 Overview

- Lilac stands on the balcony, gritting her teeth and slamming her fist into it, openly lamenting her failure for the first time she has been able to since leaving the hospital.  
- The organisation that sent the letter to Lusiae’s mother was seemingly based in the Bay side of the Split, and she is currently in the centre, a semi privileged housing location.   
- Lilac thinks that White’s offer was “too good to be true anyway” and tries to forget all about him, thinking about a smarter way to get to the Bay side.   
- She decides that instead of going around the sides like before, climbing over the top and going as the crow flies could be a more successful plan.  
- She looks back inside, towards her family in their own rooms, living as normal. Separately, together.  
- She goes into her room, and starts to rifle through her belongings, without much purpose.  
- She just looks through them all, eventually stumbling across a picture of her family much closer than they are now.  
- She changes her clothes to a cloak-like jacket, with only the top few buttons done up. She takes the picture, putting it in her back pocket, and leaves the room.   
- She goes into Chrys’ room, sitting on her sister's bed, not saying anything.  
- She doesn’t respond to anything Chrys asks, as she barely even hears it.  
- The one thing she does respond to is Chrys asking if she is okay, to which she responds with a cryptic “I will be.”  
- Chrys begs her not to leave, saying she will tell their mom, but Lilac just smiles at her.  
- She says she will be back, with a smile that is obviously false.  
- Chrys sits next to Lilac, leaning her head on her shoulder, and asks what happened to them.  
- Lilac doesn’t respond, taking in the moment before hugging her sister and leaving.  
- Lilac goes into her mom’s room, to find her sleeping, as she slowly closes the door behind her.  
- Lilac takes in a deep breath, and goes back to the balcony, looking up.  
- She uses her eye to zoom in on some potential footholds, and it works, pleasing her, as she thinks shes getting used to the new implants.  
- Because of this, she thinks about her leg, trying to turn it into something better suited for climbing, but as she tries to do so, it grows in an unexpected shape at an unexpected speed, sending her flying across the Split.  
- As this happens, her vision zoom also goes wild, and keeps swapping between zoomed in and zoomed out as she tumbles into an empty balcony on the other side of the Split from hers.  
- Lilac reshapes her leg into a leg, getting pissed off at herself for getting too cocky and assuming she could do anything  
- Lilac looks around, finally fixing her eyes so she can see now and realising where she is.  
- She decides to leave before someone finds her after trying to figure out what that crashing sound was.  
- She takes in a deep breath, creating an Energy rope, taking a small amount of Energy from her leg, attaching it to a frame above her, and she lightly pulls on it, and it doesn’t budge.  
- She then tries to climb the rope, succeeding, but being barely able to move her leg is weighing her down, making it difficult to climb.  
- She finally reaches the anchor point, and sits down on it, resting. She looks back down to see how high she has climbed after what felt like an hour. It was only 2 floors out of possibly a couple hundred. She squeezes her eyes shut and is visibly angry, though her thoughts are about the “bastards that took Lucy” wondering how they travel through here so easily.  
- She looks back at her home, wondering if she should go back for now and try again later.   
- She decides not to come back so soon after her dramatic goodbye, thinking her sister would think less of her for it  
- She instead decides to go to Lusiae’s moms, who would probably let her stay there.

**Unused Paragraphs and Sentences.**

As the manticore’s claw just barely missed White's cheek, lodging itself in the ground next to him, White's fist collided with its body, his fist imbued with Ichor, increasing his strength and sending the manticore flying away from him, crashing against the rocky terrain.

Blood coated White's knuckles and suit, as he slowly walked towards the collapsed manticore that despite the powerful punch, was still breathing heavy, laboured breaths. White suspected it wouldn't live for too much longer if it stayed in this condition. As he arrived next to the manticore it hissed, and attempted to stand back up and protect its soon to be hatched eggs.
