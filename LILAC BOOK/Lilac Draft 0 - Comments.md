`Overall Comments  
  
`More descriptive, less script-like.  
  
`A lot more like the current prologue than the later parts.  
  
`Make the speech better.  
  
Give each chapter it's own theme.   
e.g Prologue setting up the main theme of the novel which is the anti-capitalism, and that hatred needs to be used careful so as to not be self-destructive.`
```


```
`Make her angrier throughout, and have that ultimately lead to her fall and failure  
- Thematic link to how her hatred and anger will eventually harm her before she gets over it.  
- Individual action leads to nothing gained, community is important to life and change.  
  
`Make more mentions of Chrys and Riaola.  
  
`More mentions of Aureole and the Split, and how Lilac can only see a fraction of Aureole through gaps in the Split, and how she only knows rumors of it.`
```


```
Start with her implants/mods already installed.  
  
Mention Ichor reserves and absorption from imbued neutral objects, showing that it isn't limitless, it's just a technology that is common  
  
Show how Lilac is shocked at the commonness of it, with her saving up literal years for the amount of Ichor she used, before running out before getting to her destination.  
  
Still talk to White before her doctor, when she asks why White tells her that hes impatient.  
  
Have doctor mention confusion and disorientation as a symptom of the severe concussion she experienced  
  
Move convo with Chrys to chapter 3 after she recovers from her concussion more.
```


"Her sister picked up the phone"
```
Completely rework this part. (Including the renaming of Mia to Chrys, fitting with the Plant/Greek theming  
  
Have Lilac's mommy issues show up a little bit, and have Chrys mention Riaola, causing Lilac's anger. (Rework the Doctor scene to be before this, and have the Nurse scene immediately after, where Lilac lashes out at Nai, who was there when she woke up, and seems like she has a bit of a crush on Lilac.)
```


"Chapter 2"

```
Mention Beige and "Member 4" (placeholder)  
  
Slight mention of "White's plan"
```


"Chapter 3"

```
Start off with Lilac being calm, and deciding to call her sister Chrys  
  
Chrys brings up Raiola, and Lilac ends the conversation shortly after, her anger bubbling up like crazy.  
  
Keep Nai as the victim of Lilac's outburst  
  
Keep the start of the conversation with White, but maybe make it a bit better.
```

"Chapter 5"
```
First proper hint of what White's plan could be, though mention Beige and the fact that there IS a plan in the previous White chapter
```

"They were short, with a little bit of stubble on sides of their jaw,"
```
Basically imagine a sort of Genderqueer androgynous looking Edna Mode.
```
