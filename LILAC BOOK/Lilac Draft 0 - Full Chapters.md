**Prologue \- The Fall**
([[Lilac Draft 0 - Comments|Comment]])

Lilac sat and peered down over the bridge railing, the churning mass of ever-shifting wires, cables, and neon lights all the way down the Split glaring back up at her. She stood back up, pacing around, glancing repeatedly at the door to the roof she had just walked from. She had placed an Ichor bar across the handle, so theoretically it shouldn't budge if someone tried to open it. Theoretically, at least. Different scenarios kept racing through her mind, what if a person behind the door was able to just break through it? What if they could have enough Ichor to overcome her own?

The door, barred as it was, did not open. No one on the other side even tried to open it. Lilac had hoped they would, but she knew they wouldn't. She walked back to the door from where she was pacing and placed her hand on the translucent lock. It flashed, then she felt a faint rush of heat, and it was absorbed back into her reserves. 

She looked towards the sun, shielding her eyes from both it and the water of the nearby bay as she did so, and it calmed her down a little. She bathed it in for a short while, feeling the warmth on her skin for the first time in so long.

After a while, she reached down into her pocket and pulled out a pair of goggles. *You had better work.* The goggles adjusted their shape to fit her face, and quickly fit neatly around her eyes. That was an odd feeling to Lilac, as she knew they were there, even if she could just barely feel them there. As she adjusted to the new vision, faint translucent lines pointed towards certain walkways, advertisement frames, and balconies. They stretched all the way along the Split. She stepped up onto the ledge, clenching and unclenching her again and again, before releasing a blue translucent rope, attached to the inside of her palm. She gripped it tightly, occasionally letting go slightly to let more of it out, until it dragged behind her on the floor of the roof.

She picked it up, looking around for the nearest marked frame, and started to swing it around her. Her breathing picked up speed almost as quickly as the rope. She let go, her breath catching as she did so, and the rope flew across the Split, landing ever so slightly above a faint blue mark near the bottom of an advertisement for some corporate job at a Hunter Agency. She mentally pushed the end of the rope into the metal frame it landed on, and it stayed there, stuck to it. The now taut rope stayed attached to the frame after a light tug, so Lilac strongly yanked it. Still, nothing happened. She heaved a sigh of relief, before glancing down, the reality of what she was about to dawning on her.

She tried to calm herself down, but knew the only way to appease her fears would be to take a leap of faith. I promised I’d find you. I can’t wait any longer. She took in a deep breath and leaped off the bridge.

The first sensation that hit her like a pile of bricks was the lack of anything underneath her feet, as she plummeted down towards the packed street below her. The next sensation came almost immediately afterwards, as the rope yanked her under the frame she had attached it to, hurtling her towards the next anchor, a walkway which she had yet to attach a rope to. 

Still in shock, Lilac completely missed her opportunity to attach the new rope, and got pulled back to the other side of her current anchor. Regaining her wits, she followed the curve of her current momentum like a pendulum, and threw a rope from her left hand this time, landing it square on the blue dot of the next frame, pushing it in just like last time.

She hung in the air like that, attached to the two frames from both palms, as she attempted to compose herself, with mild success. She dared not look down, it felt like the blazing neon lights were trying to drag her back to the dark depths below. Not. Yet. Her eyes focused as she looked towards the next frame, and she reabsorbed the rope in her right hand. 

She immediately picked up speed as she fell towards the anchor point, but this time she was prepared, and had already prepared her new rope, ready to throw it as soon as she arced upwards. She threw it, and landed roughly where she was aiming for, and, hoping that was enough, reabsorbed her previous anchor, trying to keep some of her momentum. 

She swung past the next anchor, and the next. She laughed as she swung, the adrenaline rushing through her veins as fast as she was flying. Please, wait just a little longer. I can do it this time, I promise. 

The next anchor point, however, blinded her. From what looked like out of nowhere, a brilliant mass of white Ichor had appeared, as bright as the sun. 

Seeing this completely threw her off course, as her rope went off in a wildly different direction, hitting the corner of the advertisement frame. Her weight and momentum yanked part of the frame clean off, and sent her tumbling down into a mass of cables below, stopping her from falling, but also trapping her. 

She looked up, just as the heavy metal advertisement and its frame came crashing down towards her, the brilliant white light seemed to hesitate, before flying off like a comet, as if trying to get past away from what was happening. Lilac felt an agonising and excruciating ripping sensation in her right leg as the face of the man with stark white hair in the advertisement fell past her.

I’m sorry, I failed you. Again. 

The pain was too much for her to bear, and Lilac collapsed into unconsciousness.

**Chapter 1**
([[Lilac Draft 0 - Comments|Comment]])

Lilac woke up in a daze to the light from a window across the room beaming down on her face. Looking around, she realised she had no idea where she was. It didn’t help that she was barely able to take anything in, and only her left eye seemed to be working. She tried sitting up from the bed she was in, to no avail. Her head was throbbing, as were her legs… or rather, leg? Lilac went back to sleep.

She woke up a few hours later, with her thinking being far clearer than it had previously. This time, when she opened her working eye, she noticed she was in a hospital room. The air tasted different here, partially because it didn’t taste of anything at all. *Am I still in the East Side?* It was a possibility, but the smell of the place didn’t remind her of anything she had ever encountered before. *Besides, those colours…* Lilac tried to sit up again, this time succeeding slightly more than she had previously. As she rose, she immediately noticed what she hadn’t wanted to until then. She couldn’t feel her right leg.   
She groaned, trying to remember the events that had led her here. It was mostly a blur, but she seemed to recall a massive glow of Ichor, sending her off balance and into a faultily made advertisement for some cheerful man’s hunting agency. She pondered over what that Ichor glow was, as nurses walked in and out of her room. One of them accidentally brushed against her, their cold metal hand startling her, making her jump. The nurse apologised, and went to fetch a separate nurse to assist Lilac. Behind the new nurse, walked a somewhat young looking man, with stark white hair, wearing a black and white suit. The man leant against the doorframe as the nurse helped Lilac, replacing her pillows and adjusting the bed, sitting her up for her visitor. Lilac thanked the nurse, who bowed in reciprocation, then left, whispering something in the man’s ear as she did so.

Lilac looked at the man, who seemed to be waiting for something. 

“I suppose you’re here for a reason?”

“Not particularly, I just find the architecture of this room fascinatingly bland, don’t you agree?” The man replied with a smirk on his face, and a cheerful look in his eye. He spoke with an accent Lilac vaguely recognised from somewhere, though she couldn’t place why. He seemed to be putting on a show with his accent, overly pronouncing certain words in a way that didn’t seem entirely natural, but still sounded careful.

“Let’s admire the architecture together, then.” Lilac gestured towards one of the seats opposite her bed. The man’s green eyes seemed to sparkle as she said this, though with the way he moved, Lilac assumed it could have just been a trick of the light. 

He sat down on the seat she had pointed to, brushing his suit, and laying one leg over the other in an overly dramatic way.

He glanced at the design of the room for roughly 10 seconds before looking back at Lilac. He sighed, “You broke my sign.” 

It clicked. Lilac remembered this man because he was the face on the advertisement she unceremoniously flew into. “You look a bit different in real life.” She immediately felt embarrassed after having blurted that out. Did he think she was being insulting?

“Yes, I know, that’s partly why I’m not upset at you for destroying it the way you did.” He glanced at her missing leg. Then, in a far more serious tone than he had before looked into Lilac’s eyes. “I am truly sorry. I oversaw the design of the sign. The design which, ultimately, failed, and ripped your leg off with it.” 

Lilac stopped and stared at him. He… was apologising to her? 

“I was completely at fault, it was all me.”

“What you did was exceedingly reckless, and likely did not help the sign in staying afloat, but had it fallen without you there, it likely would have landed on the Split floor, as opposed to being trapped on the catwalk amidst a heap of wires.”

Lilac wasn’t convinced. She decided not to argue further though, and changed the topic to something else she was more curious about. 

“You felt guilty for my injuries? Is that why I’m… here?” Lilac gestured all around her, at the hospital. 

He just sighed. “My family helped fund the development of this hospital many years ago, so we have some priority for certain things. This is the VIP suite near the top of the hospital. Is that unfair? Hypocritical? If I could have it another way, I like to think that I would. Unfortunately, sometimes it doesn’t work like that.” He turned towards Lilac, his face visibly relaxing, a small smile appearing. “I was ultimately responsible for your injuries, so I did what I could to help.” 

“So I was seen almost immediately?” Lilac glanced at her leg with her remaining eye.

“If you have any questions, wait and ask your doctor, he’ll be in to see you soon.” He smirked, then added “I wanted to see you first, and let you know that this was all paid for, so you needn’t worry about anything.”

I can’t imagine this would end up being cheap.”

He smiled, standing up, and walking over to the window, the night’s darkness staring back. 

“Care to see it?”

Lilac went to stand up, subsequently falling down, still not used to only having half of her normal amount of lower bodily appendages. 

The man, Lilac still hadn’t asked his name, raised a finger towards her. Blue Ichor shot out, wrapping around Lilac’s working leg and back, keeping her balanced upright, as it moved across the floor back towards him, carrying her with it. 

As Lilac reached the window, her jaw dropped open. She had seen the city from afar a handful of times, with the Split and its two sides being on the outskirts of what was considered the full city of Aurae, but this was something else entirely. Despite being the middle of the night, the place was lit up like a firework show. Everywhere she looked had beautiful lights on display, incredibly designed buildings that made her feel like she was seeing buildings for the very first time. Holograms dotted around, cars as small as ants flying around the designated road areas in each and every direction. It was delightful.

“What do you see when you look at the city?”

“It’s beautiful.”

The man didn’t respond. He just stood there, and although it was barely noticeable, Lilac thought she could see him clenching his jaw, and his eyes. They looked like they sparked again. He noticed her watching him, then visibly relaxed his face, smiled at her, then opened the window in front of him.

“I need to go now. The construct will return you to your bed when you tap it twice. I have an offer for you to consider, so I do hope your injuries won’t take too long to recover from. Call me when you feel ready to.”

“Call you? How? Where can I find you?”

He smirked, “think of it as a test, if you’d like,” then jumped out.

Lilac paused for a while, staring, before looking out the window he had jumped from to find… nothing. There was no trace he had jumped at all.

She sat by the open window, taking in the hot air of the bustling vibrant city and its colours.

*I wish Mom and Mia were here to see this.* That thought startled her. Mom. She was probably worried sick. How long had it even been since her fall? She tapped the Augment twice, and as the man had said, it returned her to her bed. 

She called the nurse in, and asked for a phone to call her family with. 

They complied, bringing in a phone to her, and Lilac dialed the number for her home apartment.

Her sister picked up the phone, a tenseness in her voice as she answered. “H- Hello?”

“MIA\! I’m so glad to hear your voice.”

“Lils??? Where are you? You didn’t come home last night, mom and I have been worried sick.”

“Is mom with you now?”

Mia hesitated, then sheepishly answered that their mother was working. Again. Lilac just sighed. She should have expected that. “We should get some food from there at some point, together.”

“Sure, but where are you Lils?”

“Promise you won’t tell mom just yet?”

Mia hesitated again, “Not unless it’s really bad.”

“Promise me Mia, no matter what.”

Silence. Then Mia sighed, a very drawn out, exaggerated sigh. “Fine. I promise.”

“I’m in the Aureole.”

“Bogshit. Where are you.”

“I mean it\! I mean, technically I’m in a hospital here, but the hospital is in Aureole I think the Split is on the other side though, I can’t see it from my window.”

“What the hells are you doing in a hospital?”

“I got injured. Look, just, tell mom I’ll be home soon, I have a meeting with my surgeon soon, so I’ll ask him to get me home asap. Some of the tech they have here is crazy. They’ll get me patched up in no time okay? Tell mom I’m just… at Via’s or Nab’s or something.” She glanced down at her leg, a tightness swelling up in her chest, tears welling up in her eyes. Keeping as little of it showing, she then quietly muttered. “I’ll probably have to quit my job.”

Mia paused. Then, with a softness in her voice that wasn’t present before, replied, “We’ll work something out, you know us. Mom probably won’t be happy, but you know it's just because she's worried, don’t you?” 

Lilac wasn’t convinced, but said nothing. “I’ll cover for you, but only for a few days. Please come home soon. I- See ya Lils.”

“Night, M.”

Lilac put the phone down, then called for the nurse to bring in her doctor, whoever he was. While waiting for him, she laid back down, and stared at the ceiling. A nurse turned the radio on, playing some popular music she’d never heard before. She barely heard it. She just laid there, time passing over her like wind against a flagpole.

Her doctor walked in some time later, though Lilac had no clue of how long had passed since she had started spacing out. He walked with a sense of simultaneous somberness, resilience, and… hope? She found that surprising. She had known few doctors in her life though her job helped her see a few every now and then. Not for much longer I suppose. 

“Miss Lilac, I won’t keep you for long, you need your rest, after all. First, however, I believe introductions are in order. My name is Doctor Laven, and I helped tend to you after you arrived here. I did as much as I could, but there were certain things it was better to leave as they are, at least for now.”

Lilac stopped. White had implied that the doctors had done the best they could, but here was the person who physically operated on her telling her he could have done better? Who was lying? Were either of them? Or both? 

Before she could continue asking herself questions, Laven carried on.

“Your leg was an open and shut case, I’m afraid. It was torn clean off from the falling debris, and unfortunately we were unable to reattach it in time. Modern medicine has its limits, as does the human body.”

He paused, glancing at her leg, a melancholic expression passing across his face, and despite her remaining questions, Lilac believed that he was being honest with her. Trusting him, however, was another thing entirely.

“Sir White has ordered that I give you a replacement leg made out of Telenium. I have no idea how he got his hands on the metal, but I have my team working on making it ready for implanting.”

Lilac had never even heard of the metal apparently called Telenium, but she stayed quiet, thinking it best to just let it happen.

Laven walked closer to her, standing on the side of her bed she couldn’t see unless she turned her head. She turned, and Laven was much closer than she had realised. He was looking into her black eye, though it was hard to believe that from where she could see him. 

“Unlike your leg, I have no idea what to make of this. It’s fascinating. Where did you receive the equipment you were wearing before your… injuries?”

Lilac remembered winning them from an angular faced, white haired man as a child at an event in her block, telling her that she would need them one day. They had been a prized possession ever since. Had she won anything since then? Lilac tried, but couldn’t remember. 

“I don’t remember, I think I just found them in a closet somewhere. Must be a family thing I suppose.”

“Haha, I suppose it must be. You must have a very interesting family if they left such a valuable relic in a random closet.”

“Relic?”

“Well, the frame of the goggles themselves weren’t important at all, however, the glass was. You see, it was infused with a blend of the right amount of Ichor, or the right types, to make whoever looks through it be able to see Ichor. You must have noticed this while wearing it, no?”

“I… I don’t remember. It was the first time I’ve worn them since finding them, and that whole day is a bit of a blur to me.”

She wasn’t technically lying to Laven. It was the first time she had worn the goggles since winning them from that man as a child, and the whole day from when she ran, including her reason for running, was a complete blur to her. She did, however, remember seeing that massive glow of Ichor that completely vanished, along with all other sources of Ichor around her. 

“Regardless, the glass itself shattered, and sent shards of itself flying into your eye. I reviewed the footage of your fall myself, assuming that it was just some of the debris hitting you. But that assumption couldn’t have been more wrong. The glass shattered itself, and then sent part of itself flying into your eye, somehow not damaging it at all. We did scans of it when you arrived here, but there was seemingly no damage at all, and even less trace of the glass.”

“Then… my eye…”

“Is perfectly fine. Sir White said you were having issues seeing out of that one regardless though. I believe it may be a psychological issue, so if that is the case then it would be dangerous to do anything to it for now. Just know that we have an excellent selection of cybernetic replacements, and can gladly provide you with some alternatives for your working eye.” He paused, pulling out a sheet with some eye implant examples on it.

“My recommendation would be this latest Meritan model.” He pointed towards a small eye, with a symbol of a hawk on a maroon background next to it. “It is supposedly very easy to use, and there are no hormonal issues nor medication that can interfere with the installation, so you don’t have to worry about your more long term requirements. My daughter and our team know a lot more about implants than me, but from what I gather this model is also a lot easier to replace than other ones, so if that is something important to you then it is something to consider.”

Lilac stayed silent, staring at the Doctor in front of her with a confused look, not knowing how to respond, as he started towards the door, telling her that he would give her some time to think about her options, leaving her to be alone in her room. 

As he went to stand up, she thought about her mother, and her sister. *What would they say if I said yes?* A little voice in her head, one she hadn’t heard for so long, spoke to her. *Who cares what they want, what do* you *want Li?*   
“Wait\!” Lilac slowly rose, sitting up on her own for the first time since arriving in the hospital. She remembered who the voice who spoke to her belonged to. She remembered her face. Her eyes. She remembered why she was so desperate. Her jaw clenched as she spoke to the doctor. “I’ll take the Meritan.”

**Chapter 2**
([[Lilac Draft 0 - Comments|Comment]])

“Hey, you\! You’re not allowed to be h– Oh. Sir White. I’m sorry about that, I didn’t realise you were still in the hospital.”

White smiled towards the security guard with teeth that were so bright they could blind someone as he turned around and reached a hand out to point towards. *What was his name? Karin? Something beginning with K for certain.* 

“Perfect timing of you K, would you be so kind as to lend me a hand down? I seem to have gotten up here without a plan to get back down.” He chuckled warmly at the guard, who beamed a smile back, gleefully placing his hands on the ladder. *Good, I got the letter right.* 

The guard helped White down the now much stabler ladder as he patted down his suit to rid it of any dust, feeling the inside of his pocket as he did so. “Sir, this is the records room, you know taking out any personnel files requires access from multiple executives.”

“Of course, I wouldn’t dream of violating the rules of the hospital. I have exclusive access to the financial reports and I was told that some of them may have been placed here by mistake, and I was just looking for them, though all I have found so far were some rather complicated names of patient ailments.”

The short guard seemed to accept this answer, but not so subtly tried to lead White out of the room with some reluctance.

While White was certain he could get K to give him some more time, he knew he had gotten what he came for, and allowed himself to be led out. As soon as he saw the eager K looking away from the wall of records, he pointed a finger back at where he had been, as Ichor shot towards where he had just been, and formed into a coloured file where an empty hole lay. 

White left K to go to the rest of his shift with a jovial smile that left his face the second he was alone. He closes his eyes, then opens them, reappearing on the roof of the hospital. A bead of sweat drops down his head, and his breathing gets heavier as he walks towards the bayside of the Aureole Moat

White looked out over the bay side of the Aureole Moat, the golden sunlight shimmering in the reflection towards the sky. The sharp heat pressed against his skin like a vice, though he tried his best to enjoy it regardless. It worked. Slightly. 

He closed his eyes, thinking about the girl he visited. Lilac \[Last name\]. *The Relic seems to have chosen her for some reason. I need to keep her somewhere I can keep an eye on her.* 

Hovering next to him appeared a shimmering blue face with constantly shifting features, most of them indiscernible. The face looked at White, and then in the direction he was facing. It shifted about in confusion, mimicking the exact way as domesticated hellhounds or griffins do. White assumed there would be very few people with enough experience with animals of that variety to know that particular factoid, however.

I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY YOU KEEP DOING THIS MASTER.

‘White’ closed his eyes, then opened them, looking at the floating voice and smiling. “Cut yourself some slack TeVo, I rarely understand what I’m doing at any given moment either.”

SARCASM?

White chuckled, turning around from the bay and walking across the roof of Asclepius Hospital. The face followed behind him, staying level with his head as it rotated around, looking around the view with curiosity.

White sat down on the edge of the building, the face settling down beside him, trying to follow his gaze once again.

“What do you see when you look out?”

YOU ASKED THIS OF MISTRESS LILAC, DID YOU NOT?

“Be careful, she’s not your mistress yet.”

The voice stayed silent, though its features and glow shifted more aggressively. White sighed. “I did.”

DOES MY ANSWER MATTER THE SAME AS HERS?

“I already knew hers. I can guess yours, but I still want to hear it from you.”

The face turned back to face the city, slowing its shifting back to what it was before, satisfied with his answer.

I FIND IT TOO… UNIFORM. SOMETHING ABOUT IT IS TOO INTENTIONAL, THOUGH I CANNOT SAY EXACTLY WHAT.

The voice did not continue, and White knew it well enough to know it wouldn’t, even with further prodding, and decided the answer was good enough. Instead, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a file, with the name Lilac \[Last name\] on it.

HOW ARE HER INJURIES COMING ALONG?

“She seems to be mostly healed outside of her missing leg. Her right eye also has a complete loss of vision, which the doctors labelled as ‘psychological’.”

THE RELIC’S DOING?

“I still don’t know what happened, before I could even do anything the Relic exploded, sending its shards flying through her eye, but doing no damage at all.”

PUZZLING. YOU DO UNDERSTAND THE RELIC CANNOT HAVE A WILL OF ITS OWN?

“Some theorists, including Candlerai who lives just over there,” he pointed to a large building complex with a stand out building on the top, glowing with Ichor and flashing neon lights, “argue that concentrated amounts of Ichor, when combined with the right conditions, can gain what one could call a will.” 

CANDLERAI? SHE WOULD HAVE A BRAIN ANEURYSM IF SHE EVEN GLANCED AT ME ON ACCIDENT. YOU REALLY WANT TO USE HER AS AN EXAMPLE?

White ignored his partner's comment, instead changing the topic to what confused him the most about the situation.

“If it *does* have a will, then why did it choose her? Of all people it could have chosen, why her? And if it *doesn’t* have a will, then why did it happen at that very moment. You saw the footage, yes?” 

INDEED, IT WAS TROUBLING. YOU SET THE TRAP FOR SILVER?

“Except, *he* got there first. How did he even find out about it? Most importantly, did he recognise the Relic or not.”

He put those thoughts out of his mind, focussing back on Lilac’s file. Her surgeries were scheduled for the following two days, and would only require one day of recovery in the hospital before being discharged. Lilac wouldn’t be looking for him before that day of recovery. He smiled.

“TeVo, how are the Deadlands looking?”

ABOUT AS NORMAL, MASTER. THERE IS A LARGE PACK OF TYGRIS NEAR SECTOR 7C, OR IF YOU ARE FEELING HUNGRY THERE IS A COCKATRICE NEST NEAR THE OUTSKIRTS OF SECTOR 2A.

“Ill see the Tygris, thank you TeVo.”

OF COURSE, MASTER. 

The glowing face fizzled out into nothingness, as White stood up, and looked around until he found the direction of Sector 7C in the Deadlands. He placed his hands together, breathing in, then using his Ichor reserves to build himself his own wingsuit. He remembered the video of Lilac’s run and subsequent fall as he leapt off the front of the building soaring through the floating buildings of Aureole, as a allowed himself to create a trailing web of Ichor, throwing it onto certain buildings to allow him to build speed and momentum before swapping back to using his wingsuit. 

*What a fascinating young girl.*

**Chapter 3**

Lilac kept her clenched fists under her sheets as her nurse came in, smiling at her. Her nails dug into her palms but still she kept a straight face for the nurse.

“Would you like any food Miss Lilac? As a member of the VIP suite, you have quite the selection to choose from.”

“I’m not hungry.” Lilac tried to keep her tone steady, with difficulty, as she replied to the chipper nurse. The nurse said that that is likely an effect of the painkillers she is on for now, and that she should eat now before she is required to fast for her surgery. Lilac wanted to snap, but took in a deep breath, before replying.

“I’ll take a menu then.” Her fists were still clenched tight as the word ‘VIP’ repeated in her head, bouncing around like an echo in a well. 

“Nurse, would you give this same offer to any other patients here?”

The nurse looked at Lilac and opened her mouth, but the tone Lilac had spoken in, and the glare from her that felt like it pierced her soul, caused no sound to come out before she closed it quietly. She took her time responding, though when she did she had the same smile and tone as before. The only thing different was a slight twitch in her cheek, and a light in her eye that seemed somewhat worried. 

“I can certainly try to get that done for you if you *really* want me to, though you should know we have a large number of patients here that all experience the utmost care and consideration from our staff.”

“I’m sure. Do it anyway.” Lilac hesitated, then reluctantly added a meeker than intended sounding “please.” Lilac’s fists eased up slightly, though the pain in her palms remained, a repeated stinging sensation to remind her of why she was here.

The nurse nodded, then hurriedly left the room, trying to avoid Lilac’s gaze, though had she looked, she would have noticed Lilac was looking elsewhere. She audibly relaxed as she left, trying to catch up with some other staff calling for them to wait up for her.  

Lilac immediately felt a pain in her chest as she watched the nurse leave so abruptly. She kept her eyes cast down to her bed as she waited for her anger to dissipate. *It won’t help yet. It won’t help yet.* Repeating the mantra helped slightly, though she could feel some of her blood still simmering.

As Lilac looked out towards the window, she recalled White’s offer to her. Could he help her? *He’s certainly a man of means. Maybe he can help me find her.* She would wait until she was awake from her surgery the next day, then look for him around the hospital. He implied that he would be waiting for her somewhere. 

\*

“I’m sure you’ve already gathered, but your surgeries were a complete success Miss Lilac.  Firstly, your leg— The team did an excellent job grafting the Telenium to match the shape of your other leg and I am certain that you will grow accustomed to using it quickly. Our priests have applied an Illustration to your leg to make it appear more like your other leg, and you can either reapply a small amount of Ichor to it, or make your own Illustration, if that is something you wish to do.”

He moved closer to her face, before continuing to talk. “The eye implant may take some getting used to, unfortunately. You can use Ichor to move the controls around the pop-ups. I believe there is also a settings menu that allows you to customise where things are located, and what to do if you wish to temporarily hide them.”

Lilac immediately searches for this settings menu, the sensory overload of her vision being clouded by a hundred different icons all telling her different things was too much for her just after her surgery at the moment.

As she infused some Ichor into the eye, it started to go haywire. The icons spun around her vision, flickering in and out as Lilac’s head started to pound. She closed her eye in an attempt to make it stop. This helped her to an extent though there were still a couple of these pop-ups despite her eye being closed.

The reduced number made it easier for her to find the settings, and she was able to adjust both the Ichor sensitivity scale, allowing her to place more Ichor into it without losing too much control, and the ‘icon hide’ button.

She turned to Doctor Laven, smiling, now that she had gotten the eye somewhat under control for the time being. 

“I see you are taking a liking to it, excellent.” He placed a hand on her head, inspecting her eye. “Marvelous, there isn’t even a scar. Well, outside of the obvious one.” He held up a small hand mirror, showing Lilac her new face.

Where once two blue eyes lay on her face, with a small but sharp nose perched between them, now there was a piece of metal, its edges near seamlessly connecting to the skin around her brow. The iris inside was currently a shade of maroon, though she hoped she would be able to customise that once she was willing to stomach the barrage of information. She also had a look at her other eye, as she was holding the mirror. As Laven had said, it looked perfectly healthy, as if there was nothing wrong with it at all. *So why can I still not* see *out of it.* She handed the mirror back to Laven, not wanting to get angry just after her surgery.

“Excellent. Would you like me to help you stand up so we can see how your new leg feels?” He moved the chair he was sitting on out of the way, and gestured for Lilac to take his hand. Lilac moved her leg rather easily, as it was surprisingly light, despite apparently being made completely of metal. The leg did, however, remain completely stiff.

The two of them walked around the open space of the room, Laven helping her as she struggled with moving the leg around properly.

Lilac’s eyes became more downcast, and she could feel her anger bubbling up again. She tried to keep clenching and relaxing her fists as she had before, as Laven led her back to her bed. 

“Controlling your Telenium leg as if it was your other will take a lot more training than getting your eye under control, however I have faith in the gods that you will be able to do so very soon.” Laven spoke in a slightly upbeat tone, though Lilac could tell he was only trying to help her stop feeling bad about her movement not going well on her first try.

“Will I need to stay here until I can?” Lilac’s eyes widened, she had told her sister she would be back in a few days, but now she might have to master how to use both her eye AND her new leg thing? 

“No no, don’t worry about that. You should be getting some more test results back later this afternoon, but after that you should be able to leave. I am sure Sir White will make certain you are welcome anytime you need to be. He seems to have taken a liking to you— Oh. Speaking of Sir White, I believe I heard him say that you should have a look for him if you were curious about him? Well, I believe he is currently on the roof looking out over Staxia Bay. I thought now that you are able to move around, you might want to know.”

Laven smiles at Lilac, as he walks out the door, a clipboard in his hand that Lilac could probably read the text on if she wanted to. Lilac could hear as he started talking to himself in the hallway outside, wondering about what he should eat for lunch. 

*Oh, right. Food.* Lilac looked around for the remote to call her nurses, and hoped her assigned nurse hadn’t changed since the day before. Sure enough, a short time later the now still bubbly nurse wandered into Lilac’s room though she only made eye contact when she had to, and her sentences were a lot shorter.

“Miss Lilac?”

“What’s your name?” Lilac tried to smile at her, but couldn’t help but start frowning as her chest started to ache again.

“I’m Nai.”

“Nai… I wanted to apologise for last night. I was rather sharp with you, I’m sorry, I remembered something important I had forgotten, and it made me rather on edge.”

“Oh, umm. Apology accepted, thank you. Is there anything else you would like me to help you with?”

“No, although I was planning to go for a short walk around the hospital, so if you need to do anything for that then please do.”

Nai nodded emphatically, and left the room in a hurry, returning a short time later with a form that tells the hospital that Lilac accepts any and all responsibility for anything that may happen while she is walking around the hospital. Lilac scoffs at the form, and Nai gives her a rather apologetic look, but explains it is the company that runs the hospital’s requirement.   
Lilac reluctantly fills out the form, as Nai once again leaves, returning this time with a pair of crutches instead. She hands the crutches to Lilac, helping her adjust them to her height, and asks if there is anything else she can do to help.

“I don’t think so, thank you Nai.” Lilac smiles and awkwardly goes to hug Nai, now that they are standing up together. Nai gladly accepts the hug, as some of the awkwardness goes away. “You’ve been a big help, and I’m sorry again about yesterday.”

“Oh it's okay, I really understand that kind of thing. I was just… caught a little off guard, is all. I accept your apology. Anyway, I'll let you enjoy your walk. Let me know if you need me afterwards.” Nai walks off down the hall, her back seeming to be a little straighter.

Lilac instead walks towards the hologram on the wall showing a map of the hospital. She clicked through the floors, and it apparently showed the number of people on each floor, with the current floor A-25 having 94 patients. Lilac kept scrolling through the floors, eventually reaching the roof. There was a single person up there, apparently just labelled ‘Important.’ Lilac sighed, looking back towards her room. She thought about changing her clothes before going on her walk, but decided she would be coming back anyway, so left to see what White was waiting for.

As she walked along the hallways of the hospital, she started to feel somewhat glad that she was in the VIP suite. The hallways felt like a labyrinth, and at least the VIP suite had signs pointing to it all over the place. She thought for a moment, then sat down on a chair near her, wanting to prepare for what she was about to do.

As she imbued a very small amount of Ichor in her eye, she was able to unhide all the icons, and tried to see what ones she would likely never use, and if she could remove them. It felt like there were hundreds, and she disabled useless ones like email and weather services that she felt she would never use, but she finally cleared the screen enough for it to be much less cluttered. 

She decided to keep a couple of apps for now, as she could always re-enable the others if she wanted. She thought that the magnify feature would probably be quite handy in the Split, as well as the translate feature, though how that worked she still didn’t quite know. The feature Lilac thought would be the most useful at the moment, however, was the marking feature, that allowed her to mark specific locations, and access their distance and direction at a later time. Lilac marked the chair she was currently sitting on, then continued walking towards White, a small icon popping up as she did so. *Huh. That’s neat.*

Lilac reached the elevator, and hoped that it would go to the roof without requiring any security. She pressed the roof button, and nothing happened. She pressed it again, and nothing happened, she sighed, pressing the A30 button, and the doors started to close. She closed her eyes, finally managing to turn on the setting that allowed for her to hide all icons when her eyes were closed, and waited. She barely heard the music start before arriving at… the roof. Lilac was confused as to why the elevator went straight to the roof, but stepped out anyway, to find White, in a completely different, yet still overly dramatic, bright purple suit, smiling at her the exact same way as he had on the advertisement.

Lilac started hobbling towards him, his purple suit guiding her like a beacon of light, when he opened his palm, a flicker of blue Ichor flying out, moving into her leg. 

“Try to imagine you have your old leg back. It was only a few days ago you lost it, so it can’t be *that* hard.” White chuckled, though stayed facing towards the bay, only turning his head slightly so Lilac could still hear his voice. Though Lilac heard no difference in White’s voice, she sensed something she couldn’t quite parse coming from him, as if he was remembering something he hadn’t wanted to. 

She tried to do as he said, imagining that her leg was back to being her old one. She looked down at it, and the Illustration the hospital staff had placed on it still held strong, making it appear as if it was back to being her previous leg. She tried to bend her knee, and it started to bend, but she heard a slight scratching of metal as her foot scraped against the floor of the roof, and the leg locked in place, only now it was slightly bent backwards, making it even harder to walk. 

White turned at the noise, seeing Lilac lock her leg up, opening his palm again, the leg fixing itself as the same blue flicker of Ichor returned to him. As he reabsorbed it, Lilac thought she could see a minor shift in its colour, though it was gone by the time it registered. 

“Worth a try I suppose. Seems like you’ll get the hang of it eventually.”

“What even was that?”

“Telenium, the material your prosthetic is made from, becomes extremely malleable when combined with Ichor, as is that neat eye of yours I suppose, though in a different way.” White paused for a moment, before commenting, with a smirk “I like it, it suits your face.” Lilac blushed at his comment, smiling at the compliment.

“I uhh. Haven’t really had much of a chance to look at myself today.”

Almost as soon as the words entered her mouth, a rush of Ichor flew around in front of her, forming… herself. Lilac stared, jaw wide open, at the seemingly perfect copy of her standing right in front of her, only a few feet away. White walked around the copy, poking his hands through her face, moving hair in order to show off the implant in Fake-Lilac’s face, and Lilac’s own hair and face started to feel itchy, as if it was also being touched.

“Stop… Please.” The words came out of Lilac’s mouth almost in a whisper.

White looked at Lilac, whose eyes had just sunken low, and though he was still a few feet away, heard Lilac’s plea. The copy instantly vanished. “Sorry about that, you said you hadn’t seen yourself, so I thought it would be helpful to see your new implant.”

Lilac’s face started to look a little brighter as the clone vanished, as she finally managed to catch up to White, now standing in the same place her copy was just in. She stepped a little to the right. 

White clapped, startling her. “So. I’ll give you three questions before I give you my offer.”

“Will the offer change depending on the questions?”

“Question 1\. They might, but I don’t expect they will.”

Lilac stared at White disapprovingly. “Did that really count as a question?”

“Question Two. Yes, it did.”

Lilac froze. She had had quite a few questions for him, like who he is outside of this hospital, or why he’s interested in her. *How is he so good at using Ichor?  Can I do the same?*

“This is ridiculous, you can’t expect me to believe those counted.”

White stayed silent, waiting patiently for her third and final question. Lilac paced around. She kept stopping, opening her mouth to ask her question, then closing it again. She tried and tried to think of the perfect question, with many different long and convoluted wordings popping in her head to try and get a *useful* answer from him, but none of them seemed to work, he could just avoid them, or even lie. 

Lilac stopped in front of him, looking up. He was still there, smiling back at her patiently, hands clasped behind his back. She turned around, walking towards the edge of the roof, this time facing the city, as the sun was setting behind them. She sat down on the edge, White following suit and sitting down beside her.

Lilac raised her arm, gesturing towards the city beneath them.

“What do you see when you look at the city?”

**CHAPTER 4 \- Lilac POV**

White laughed so hard he started to fall off the edge of the roof, quickly creating a Construct of a platform to keep him up right. He calmed down rather quickly, before speaking to Lilac in his normal voice. 

“Very good question.” His eyes looked out towards the city, the sun had almost fully set by this point, and Lilac waited for an answer, genuinely curious. The lights of the city were starting to turn on, the buildings and their floating halves weaving a tapestry of light like a disco ball, as the neon lights clashed with the quickly setting sun, its reflections sparkling across the bay. 

“When I look across this city, I see the people I have become close friends with. I see memories of joy and laughter. I see people going about their lives trying to enjoy it.” He sighed, continuing. “This place is supposed to be perfect, and if I only saw those things, perhaps it would be. Unfortunately, I see more. I see the loss of loved ones. I see families still torn apart by the day. I see friendships failing and heartbreak ensuing.” His voice started to take on a much darker tone, and his eyebrows furrowed, his eyes fixating on the palace, as his fists clenched. “But most of all Lilac? I see the ones who they refuse to see working tirelessly for their scraps. I see remnants of cities whose names and people are long lost to time crumble into dust and drift away to make space for yet another pleasure centre. I see the bloodshed it took, the blood it still takes, to create this supposed utopia. I see blood dripping down every building and hands that won't be clean no matter how much they are washed or changed. What do I see when I look at the city?” He turned to her, his previously normal looking eyes burning with a black flame inside. “I see misery and death.”

Lilac’s eyes went wide, though she couldn’t move. Her eyes stayed open as long as they could, but when she blinked, the fire in White’S eyes had vanished completely, and they were back to their normal bright green hue. White motioned to stand up, but Lilac stayed frozen in place. He looked at her, then moved over to grab a chair.

“If you’re gonna stay frozen like that, I’d rather you stay alive for now.”

She stayed in place anyway. White sighed, then sat down next to the chair. “You know, I really didn’t *mean* to scare you. Sometimes I just get a bit carried away with the drama is all. It must have been quite a good Illustration for you to get *this* scared by it.”

Lilac’s blinks start to return to a normal rate, and she feels her movement come back slightly, as she turns to look at White’s feet. “So, those flames were…”

“An illustration. A very impressive one, but an illustration nonetheless.”

“But… I didn’t see you…”

“I’ve had a long time to practise getting good at creating them quickly.”

Lilac pauses, then looks at White, though still avoiding his eyes for the time being. *What about the first time it happened? In my room?* “I’m sorry. I don’t know what’s been wrong with me recently.” 

“I can tell you’re angry about something, that might have something to do with it..”

“Am I? It feels like I keep forgetting the subject of my anger. Even now I only barely remember why I feel this anger.”

“What is it that you do remember?” White tried to meet her eyes, but Lilac kept avoiding them.

“It doesn’t matter at the moment. I asked my three questions.”

White briefly raises an eyebrow, but then lowers it again. “You did indeed. In short, I want you to join my Hunting Agency.”

Lilac blinks. She blinks again. “Your…. What?”

“Hunting Agency. We take bounties on monster contracts, and dispose of them for a reward. Never heard of them?”

“Huh. How do you… dispose of them?”

“Depends. If trying to restrain them is too dangerous, then there is always the option of killing them, but I would rather avoid that if possible, unlike certain other Agencies”

Lilac, still avoiding White’s gaze and shining teeth, looked out across the city. She thought about the speech White had given. *How can something so beautiful cause so much pain?* She wanted to believe that he was mistaken, that there must have been some misunderstanding somewhere and that this beautiful place wasn’t built on unmarked graves and split families. *Those eyes…* 

“Where would we be living?” Lilac suddenly asked him, a question floating around her brain, needing an answer.

“Here in Aureole. I have an office already, and it has an apartment building attached so the five of us can easily access all the facilities.”

“Only five people? Is that really enough?”

“Five is the minimum number of people required to set up an independent agency. I’m sure you’ll get along with almost everyone just fine.”

“Almost?”

White didn’t respond, instead choosing to reach out his arm, sending a beam of blue Ichor, extremely visible now that the Sun had set completely. The beam suddenly stopped above a lower down, unremarkable looking building near the edges of the city. White pointed it out to her, and she nodded in acknowledgement that she had seen it. Lilac looked at it for a moment, then decided to use a little Ichor to mark the location in her eye.

“It’s a nice location, easy bay access too, which is always helpful. Do you like swimming?”

“... Swimming?”

“Guess not. No matter.” He clapped his hands together, the noise echoing around in the quiet night sky. White went to open his palm again, but stopped himself.

“Any more questions?”

“My family. Would they be okay?”

“You can move them out here too if you like, though, they wouldn’t be working for us. If not I can help provide them with needed funds, should you and they desire them.”

Lilac met White’s eyes. This offer was too good to be true. It had to be. Besides… *Riaola*. Lilac’s fists clenched tightly shut, and her breathing hardened. She tried repeating the mantra, but nothing seemed to be helping. *Not now not now not now.* 

“I can’t accept yet.”

White looked at her, with a quick glance at her fists before returning to her eyesight.

“Yet, huh.”

“The offer will stay open?”

“If you want it to, I can make it so.”

“Good. I have important things I need to do first.”

White gave her an expression that Lilac couldn’t quite parse, though she avoided doing anything that might tell him that.

“I can send you back now if you would like.”

“That would be helpful.”

White stepped towards her, gesturing to place a hand on Lilac’s shoulder. “May I?”

Lilac said nothing, instead placing White’s hand firmly on her right shoulder, her eyes not leaving his, and White couldn’t hide the smirk that was creeping along his face. 

“Close your eyes, it’ll just take a second.”

As she went to close them, Lilac saw White surrounding the two of them with Ichor, and before she knew it he asked her to open them again.

They were *in* her room back in the Split.

“How— Show=off.”

White, with an exaggerated hand motion and tone of voice replied, “I do try my best.” and started walking towards her door. 

“How will I find you again?”

“Lets hope you remember where the office is.” He gave her a knowing wink, before continuing. “Try to make your way back there if you decide to accept my offer. If you don’t arrive in… let's say a week, then I’ll assume you’re either dead as a door knocker, or not coming. Deal?”

Lilac paused. A week? All she has to go off of is the return address of some letter. *Can I really find the answers I need in one week?* She assumed the answer would be no, but it might be worth a try anyway. She thinks that perhaps she could find more answers in Aureole, if she ends up nowhere here.

“If there is nothing else, then I shall bid thee farewell.” White bows exaggeratedly as he backs out of the room. He leaves for just a moment, before sticking his head back in. “Oh, there is one more thing. Good luck getting to Aureole, I have a feeling you’ll need it.”

And with that ominous farewell, White left. Lilac considered going after him, but she had a feeling he would have completely disappeared from her apartment, despite only just leaving her room, the furthest from the exit.

*How* does *he do that? I can barely make a single Construct, and he can do all that with the flick of a wrist? I need to accept that offer after I find you Riaola.* 

Lilac’s anger started rising even more, until she glanced at herself in her mirror, and noticed, to her horror and embarrassment, that this entire time she had been wearing a hospital gown, instead of her normal clothes. At the same time, she heard the sound of the front door to the apartment opening. Lilac scrambled to her closet, quickly changing out of her hospital gown and stuffing it down the side of her bed, changing into something more comfortable and dignified before going out and seeing who came home, even if she already had a pretty good guess.

\*

Lilac stepped out of her room after finally putting on her clothes to find her sister Chrys in the kitchen. Lilac pauses before walking out, quietly returning to her room, slumping down in her chair and looking in her mirror. She places a hand on her face, tracing a finger around the join between her implant and her face. It looked almost like a virus spreading out from around her eye as the scarring around the metal hadn’t quite healed yet.

Lilac stayed there for some time, not even realising when her door started to creak open, the squeaking sound going straight through her ears, completely missing her brain. The shout, however, *did* alert her back to reality. 

“Wh- What? What happened?” Lilac sputtered out, turning to find her sister frozen in place, staying at her eye. *She must think I’m a monster.* Lilac wanted to say something, but she had a feeling that anything she might say would just make it worse, so the two of them sat there for what felt like an hour. Chrys was staring directly at Lilac’s implant, and Lilac wondered how she would feel about the leg which, glancing down just to make sure, still had the Illustration that the Artists had applied to it.

“Oh. my. GOD.” Chrys rushed to Lilac’s bed, spinning Lilac around to face her on her chair so fast that she almost worried she would throw up. Lilac felt her sister’s hand brush against her cheek, before feeling nothing but the uncomfortable sensation of knowing there is something near your eye. 

She went to open her mouth, but no words came out. What could she say? 

“That’s. So. COOLLLL\!\!\!\!”

What? Did she hear that right? Cool? She probably meant cruel, she did almost scream it right next to her ear, and she could barely hear anything for a second afterwards. Lilac placed her hand on her ear, squeezing her eyes shut.

“Sorry, sorry. I’m just so excited.” Chrys spoke much quieter now, but still with that air of holding back squeals of joy and curiosity. Lilac slowly reopened her eyes and just stared at her sister.

“You don’t… think it’s gross?” The words came out in a choke, and Lilac only realised she was crying when she felt tears running down the right side of her face.

“Are you kidding?? It’s amazing. How does it feel? What can you do with it? What’s it like having one mod eye and one normal?”  
More questions came out of Chrys’ mouth like a broken dam, only relenting when she herself noticed Lilac’s tears, and went to hug her.

Lilac felt a cold sensation on her neck as Chrys held them together, with Chrys’ golden looking necklace feeling like it was ice against her skin. Lilac didn’t care. She clung to her sister and sobbed into her shoulder, Chrys reassuring her that she’s okay.

Chapter End here?

**Chapter 5 \- White POV**

MASTER, WHY DID YOU NOT MENTION ME TO MISTRESS LILAC?

The face shifted uncomfortably though no response came, as it floated around White as he stood on a catwalk in the Split, just slightly below a broken metal frame. White furrowed his eyebrows, examining the surroundings, trace amounts of Ichor filling his vision in certain locations from a scan TeVo had performed. Lilac's escapade was a few days ago, very few traces of her Ichor would remain, but White wanted to view the scene anyway.

He recalled the different angles of the footage he witnessed from the accident, and it all led to one conclusion. Something drew her attention away from her path, and she ended up falling because of it. 

“Find anything yet?”

UNFORTUNATELY NOT, THE MAJORITY OF THE RELIC'S TRACES HAVE VANISHED. I FIND THAT RATHER ODD. PURE ICHOR SHOULD LEAVE MORE OF A TRACE, SHOULD IT NOT? I CAN SEE I DO.

“You're sort of a unique case, but yes, Purified Ichor's remnants should last far longer than this. Perhaps the Relic is hiding itself. That would explain why it drew itself into Lilac's eye. But why? I have no clue how long the Relic has been in her possession, it has been missing for longer than that girl has been alive.”

White closed his eyes, sighing as he leaped up to the metal frame, the catwalk clattering as he did so. *This was supposed to only be a message for Beige. I need to be more careful.* He placed a hand on the frame, tracing down it carefully until he came across… a clean cut? *Perhaps I wasn't entirely at fault.* 

“TeVo, scan the frame itself.”

AS YOU WISH, MASTER WHITE. I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WOULDN'T— OH. OH DEAR. 

“What did you find?”

MASTER, *HE* WAS HERE.

White groaned, and his partner's face shifted more nervously than White had seen in a long, long time. White couldn’t blame TeVo for that, few people who had encountered Iocaiser lived to tell the tale. TeVo was the only, complicated exception. Excluding White himself, at least. White told TeVo he could be dismissed if he needed it, and the Ichor that held the face together evaporated, leaving behind a faint after-image that quickly faded.

White placed his hand around the now visible Black Ichor, though he still had to strain his vision to see it. He heard a voice speaking through it as his hand grazed it. “Ah, if it isn't my dear younger brother. I must say it is truly an honour for you to grace us with your presence, we all miss you so *deeply*. Come back to your family.” White clenched his fist so hard he crushed the remaining metal frame that the Ichor was attached to, and part of it fell to the catwalk below, landing with a sharp clang. The voice continued on, though White tuned it out. It wasn't as if it was live anyway. It had been an age since White had heard Iocaiser's voice, and it had been far too soon for his liking.

White leapt off the ledge he was on, falling down all the way to the bottom of the Split, dodging and weaving through the catwalks, pipes, and clothes lines until he reached the very bottom, crowded with people. He slowed himself down with a platform Construct just before reaching the end, dismissing it and hopping down after reaching a height where he was satisfied he would not land directly on top of anyone walking through the busy street. 

It was a good thing he waited, as a massive crowed had formed beneath him where they were marvelling at the size of his Construct. Whispers of Aureole passed through, and White distinctly heard someone mention the Priests of Harrow. *I wouldn't be caught* dead *worshipping Harrow.* The crowd cleared a small space for White as he landed on the uneven bricks on the ground. Before the space could refill with people coming closer to White, he created a cloud of Ichor, engulfing the crowd, as he cast an Illustration on himself.

The cloud dissipated, and White had vanished from the centre. The passers-by cheered, some even praying, and looked around to see if they could see him. One passer-by started clapping, then stopped, and walked down the road in search of some food. This passer-by had long, blonde hair, with a small scar going from around the back of his left ear all the way to the top of his lip. If you asked him how he got it, he would tell you he was in a mugging incident, and would rather not bring up painful memories. He would be lying, of course. White had just improvised the design of his scar and hadn’t thought of an excuse for it yet. He had a couple of scars and stories in reserve of course, but he wanted to test his improvisational skills. The scar was visible enough that those who glance at him would be unlikely to notice the slightly unnatural shade to his eyes, or the way his teeth seemed almost too perfect. White still hadn’t quite perfected his Illustrations, though only extremely experienced Artists like Lily would be able to tell, and only in certain circumstances. Still he practised new techniques, pushing his Ichor usage to the next level every time, he would surely reach perfection any year now. 

White dipped into a small side street with very few pedestrians walking down it, and into a small shop with a slightly broken sign. If the alleyway had smelled like someone had combined the smells of a freshly made curry with rotting meat, the shop smelled like the vegetables in the curry were rotten too, as well as the chef who prepared it. White gestured to scratch his nose, quickly casting a hidden Illustration inside it that smelled like the Aureo Bay. 

Now able to stand inside the shop without wanting to get out of there as soon as possible, he walked towards the cashier. They were short, with a little bit of stubble on sides of their jaw, and they spoke in a nasally tone that made White consider attempting to create a makeshift Illustration on his ears to change how the sound waves sound when they enter. Alas, he dealt with the cashier in his usually cheerful way.

“Whadaya want.”

“I heard you're someone to talk to if I want information on someone's whereabouts.”

“Say who?”

“Oh, everyone, and I must say, your shop seems remarkably well maintained and—”

“Cut the rich boy shit, whadaya want.”

“I was being honest, but if you want to get straight to business I shall. I'm looking for someone I know by Lily Valerie. I was wonder if you knew where she is.”

“20 \[money\] and a ball of Ichor.”

“15 and half.”

“20 and a ball.”

“17 and ¾”

The cashier stared straight at White. “Twenty. And. A. Ball.” They emphasised each word with extra pronounciation, their thick accent mixing with their nasally voice making them sound even more grating to White's ears, though he kept his cheery smile.

“You really know what you want, when you want it.” He chuckled, and produced a standard sized wooden ball from his pocket, about the width of two finger nails, it was perfectly smooth. He fully infused it with Ichor, a fraction of his internal stores getting transfered, and placed it on the cashiers desk. He reached back into his pocket and produced a handful of large silver coins. 

“The extra is for you, treat yourself to something nice, a young lady like yourself deserves all the treats she can get.”

The old cashier huffed, pocketing the coins, and White noticed, just barely, a hint of a smile, for the first time since entering their shop.

“Lily is a good girl. Why you want her?”

“I plan to give her a job.”

“I no know where she is, but I know she will come here.”

“Excellent. When she does, will you give her this for me?”

White produced a small card with an image and no text on it. The image showed a \[think of White's logo\], and the cashier nodded. White thanked them gracefully, finally seeing a fully visible smile on their face, and left to go back to the street. As he walked away from the shop, he realised that he had actually gotten used to the smell, and was starting to miss it.

*Perhaps my initial reaction was a bit harsh. Regardless, Lily will not be naive enough refuse me two to go. After Lilac and brother destroyed it I doubt Beige received my message, I'll have to figure something else out for that one.*

**CHAPTER 6 \- LILAC POV**

Chrys placed the plates down on the table in front of them, handing Lilac her cutlery. Lilac took it, thanking her, and immediately started digging into her food.

“Yknow, I didn't expect hospital food to be that good. I guess that's one of the better VIP benefits.”

Chrys chuckled, then, before fully swallowing her food, managed to stumble out a quick “So, how'd you be made a VIP anyway?” Had Lilac not spent years practising how to decipher it, she would have had no idea what her sister was saying. Fortunately, she figured it out rather quickly, and was able to think about her response.

“Some rich guy accidentally made a faulty advert with his face plastered over it. Apparently he felt guilty that I got hurt and wanted to make it up to me.” She paused, glancing down towards her leg. The illustration that had been placed on it was still active, but she could feel the weight of the metal attached to her, weighing her down. She pointed to her eye, “He paid for these too, pretty neat huh?” 

“They look sick. Love the way the chrome looks against your hair.” Lilac tried to ignore the hint of envy that she felt she could hear in her sister's voice. Implants and Mods, especially as high quality as Lilacs, are a rare sight in \[Lilac's section of The Split\], and Lilac wondered if she would be able to apply a minor illustration to make it look lower quality. *I could barely make a functional Construct when I needed to.* She put the thought away for now. She wouldn't be seeing many more people for a few days anyway.

Chrys just laughed, “Mom would freak the fuck out if she saw you implant phaha. I guess hiding in your room earlier was probably the best choice.”

“At least she knew I was back.” *Not that she would have noticed I was gone.*

Chrys looked her sister in the eye, pausing there for what felt like an uncomfortably long time. She sighed, “You're leaving again, aren't you?”

“I'm sorry. I need to check in on Lyao… and then I have some other important things I need to do.”

Chrys closed her eyes, though Lilac couldn’t tell what she was feeling based on the rest of her facial expressions. She made a guess that she was worried, and weakly spoke out. “I won't be long. I promise.”

Chrys eventually reopened her eyes, grinning at Lilac. “You'd better not get any more mods before me. I've been saving up for over a year y'know?” She reached across the table, ruffling Lilac's hair. “I can't let my lil sis become cooler than me now, can I?”

Lilac smiled. *Little sister…* “I'm already taller than you.” 

“That doesn't count, you had an advantage.” 

Lilac chuckled, “Nah, you just had a disadvantage. Shorty.”

The pair continued making jabs at one another, pointing out minor things that they knew the other didn't mind being made fun of for, over the course of the meal. Eventually, they finished the meal, and Lilac stood up, her metal leg nearly flipping the table over without her realising it. 

“You sure you'll be fine getting to Riaola’s with that anchor?” 

“I'll manage. It's not *that* far. Once I get to the Tiger's walk I'll be set.”

“I assume offering my help will only make you less likely to accept?”

“How could you have guessed?”

Chrys went to sit down, then paused, turning back to hug her sister. “Please, be safe. Okay? Come back to me. I can't—” Her voice catches in her throat, and her expression changes before she continues. “What would happen to my reputation if word gets out I let you lose that mod.”

Lilac embraced the hug, “I'll be fine, I love you Li.”

“You should, I'm great.” Lilac scoffed in response, waddling out the door with her limp leg stomping on the ground as she tried to walk normally, making a clanking sound as she stepped onto the metal outside the door to their apartment. As soon as she stepped outside, the smell of oil and disinfectant filled her nostrils. It was only now, after returning to the smell, that she realised she couldn’t smell even a hint of it while in Aureole. Lilac was a rather tall girl, something she lauded over her sister relentlessly, and was occasionally forced to bend over slightly to avoid getting her hair caught in the loose cables and wires running across the street roof. 

Lilac felt conflicted as she walked down the street, turning around corners in a way that seemed almost random. She occasionally nodded at certain people she recognised in shop windows, though she neither said anything to any of them, nor glanced up enough for them to get a good enough look at her modded eye in the mostly dark, but still lit up street lights. She liked it here, its… home. But she couldn’t deny, as much as she wanted to, that there was a part of her that longed to go back to Aureole. She remembered White’s speech, and that only made her more conflicted. He seemingly lived in the city out of… hatred? She had no idea why he stayed there, but he certainly lived rather luxuriously despite his obvious anger. She remembered the vitriol in his voice as he spat towards the city, those flames in his eyes. *Those flames… was it really just an illustration?* 

She put it out of her mind, realising how exhausted she was from walking with a hunk of limp metal attached to her leg, and searched for somewhere to sit down for a moment, before continuing on to Tiger’s Walk. She glanced around, getting her bearings. She had just passed Narik’s pawn shop, she could turn left two streets down and walk straight there. That would require walking past her mother’s restaurant. She could smell it already, her mother loved using spices and herbs in her cooking, and the small streets in \[Lilac’s section of the Split\] trapped the smell nicely. The smell itself might have lured Lilac towards it if she wasn’t sitting down at the moment.

She decided to wait on choosing which way to go until she felt she was ready to continue on, though the way that the thought of going past her mother and getting noticed caused her foot to clench made her feel like she had already made the decision. She ignored that, instead trying to look at her leg. It was about midday, but it was a work day, so fortunately the street itself was rather empty, with only the occasional passerby. Lilac had thankfully remembered to bring a small amount of Ichor with her, she knew from experience not to take *too* much with you, lest it get stolen and sold, usually back to you, for a far steeper price. She pulled the small metal ball from her pocket, there was a slight crack in it, but fortunately the Ichor remained imbued. She absorbed it, and felt the Ichor fill her reserves. It wasn’t as much as she had used… before her fall, but she wasn’t thinking very clearly in the moment, and wasted her entire stash that she hid in Rio’s closet. 

It should be enough for now, however. She hoped, anyway. She tried to remember what the doctor said, and imbued her leg with her Ichor. She… felt it. She wasn’t exactly sure how, but she felt an odd sensation she hadn’t felt when White had used his own Ichor on her leg. Now that she was able to experience some feeling in her leg and foot, she decided to try and stretch her toes. They started to stretch. She could see her toes bend back towards her, feeling slightly differently then when she stretched with her. And then they bent even further. And further still. Before she realised it, all her toes had bent all the way backwards and were starting to attempt to bend further, as if they wanted to spiral into infinity. Lilac quickly stopped bending her toes, but they remained where they were. She gazed down in shock at her foot, which now bared a striking resemblance to a snail’s shell. She barely even noticed the fact that, despite her ability to feel her leg, she was in no amount of physical pain at the swirling toes.

Trying to not make her leg any worse, her eyes grew wide when the leg snapped back to numbness as she reabsorbed the Ichor she had imbued her leg with As feeling left her leg, so too did the spiralling, with the metal foot going back to how it had looked like before, as if nothing had happened to it. She bent down and touched her now normal shapen foot and toes. She felt nothing. She paused, then doubting this was in any way a good decision, reimbued her leg with the Ichor, only a faint amount of the reserves having been used up, as normally happens when you imbue and absorb too quickly in succession, She felt that same feeling in her leg, though decided to avoid bending any of her toes for the time being. She stood up, deciding to place her weight down on it. As she pressed into the ground with both feet, she felt as if she would be able to walk. Then, her left side started to rise. And rise again, her leg growing longer as she subconsciously pushed it into the ground, with nowhere to go. She sighed, quickly reabsorbing the Ichor.

Lilac stumbled, nearly losing her balance as her leg returned to its normal, leg-like state, though she managed to stay upright. She checked her pockets, looking to see how much cash she had brought with her. Not much. She hadn’t had much in her room to begin with, but she had brought even less out. 







She decides to buy a cane in the pawn shop next to her moms restaurant.

As she is leaving she sees her mom going inside the building on the other side of the street waiting some tables.

She rushes past hoping not to get seen, but fails.

Her mom gives her a hug but then says shes really busy and then just goes straight back to work.

Her mom doesn’t even notice the implant in her eye, or the cane in her hand.

Lilac keeps walking, glad that she didnt get stopped for too long, and surprised at how nice the cane is for how cheap it was

Chapter end as she gets to Tiger’s Walk and looks down over the Split.

(Chapter 5 plan)  
White stands on an empty bridge in the middle of the Split talking to TeVo……

White says that TeVo have to wait until Lilac officially joins before he can meet her……

TeVo mentions he already knows a significant amount about her, and tells White that he will not lie to her about that…..

White says he doesn’t mind, so long as he keeps the important things hidden until the time is right….

TeVo says he doesn’t want to, but will follow White’s request anyway…..

The two of them talk about the upcoming members, and how long until the plan will be able to be put into motion…..

He says that once Beige arrives they should be set to start….

TeVo mentions there will be pushback from *him* and White says that he is counting on it…..  
(him \= Iocaiser)

White says the Relic’s appearance surprised him, but that it is extremely helpful….. 

TeVo wonders how a seemingly unimportant girl in the Split managed to get her hands on something as powerful as the Relic, and why it appeared in the shape it did……  
(The Relic is basically made from completely pure Ichor, all the Ichor that everyone uses is diluted, but the Relic is a permanent object created from pure Ichor. It allows Lilac to see Ichor in other objects because it ‘wants’ to absorb it.)  
(The Relic can be used to purify Ichor, which can then be used to perform insane feats.)

White says he needs to find that out from Lilac at some point…..

Chapter ends with White dropping to the bottom of the Split and taking care of some adolescent bird-like “Monsters”, creating a proper safe nest for them, as he mentions the plan will help them too…...

(Chapter 6 Plan)

Lilac and her sister are eating lunch. 

Their mother came home briefly then left again shortly afterwards.

Lilac had stayed hidden from her in her sister’s room, not wanting to show her mother her new tech just yet.   
(Lilac has mommy issues)

Lilac shows Chrys her leg, the Illustration having worn off almost completely.

Lilac says that she’s glad Chrys is appreciative of her new mods, but they both agree that other people probably won’t be given how clean it looks   
(Since it was done in Aureole, not the Split)

Lilac says she plans to go to Riaola's later, then has somewhere she needs to be, and will be back in hopefully just a couple of days.

Chrys is visibly worried by this, but understands, wishing her sister good luck, knowing how much Riaola meant to Lilac, possibly more than Lilac herself.

Lilac leaves, asking Chrys to tell their mom she's at Riaola's, then adds a small “if she even asks” to the end.

Lilac traverses her way through the Split to get to Riaola’s mom's place. She lands on the balcony and lets herself in with the key under the lilacs's flower pot. 

Riaola's mom is there, and Lilac and her hug, both crying. Some pictures of Riaola have been taken down and put in a box.

Riaola's mom doesn't even notice Lilac's eye until after they stop hugging, and is shocked that its so clean looking, and Lilac briefly explains what happened, and how a rich guy who's advertisement was here in the Split caused her crash, and he felt guilty so took her to a good hospital

Riaola’s mom tries to give Lilac some of Riaola's belongs, saying Riaola doesn't need them anymore, and would want Lilac to have them, but Lilac says she can't take them at the moment, as she needs to leave soon  
(She can feel her anger reaching a boiling point, combined with sadness)
